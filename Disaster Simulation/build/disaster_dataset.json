      "In developing countries like India, schools \nare often located in vulnerable areas and \nunprepared to respond to emergencies. In recent \nyears, schools in India have witnessed many \ncatastrophic incidents: a fire led to the deaths of \nover 400 people —about half of them students—\nat a school’s prize giving ceremony in Dabwali \nHaryana in 1995; In 2001 a total of 31 teachers \ndied and 95 were injured; 971 students perished \nand 1,051 were injured in the Bhuj Earthquake, \nGujarat. Formal education was disrupted due to \nwidespread damage to physical infrastructure. \nMany of the buildings collapsed and many \nother were declared unfit for use. Many of these \nbuildings had been poorly constructed, lacked \nearthquake resistant features and were badly \nmaintained. A fire at the Lord Krishna School \nin Kumbakonam, Tamilnadu took the lives of \n94 children in 2004; thousands of students \nand teachers were killed, injured or otherwise \naffected in the 2004 South Asia Tsunami; and 15 \nchildren and 3 teachers died in a boat accident \nduring a school picnic at Kerala in 2007. \nEducation, public awareness and proper training \nfor enhancing the capacity is the cornerstone \nof approaches aimed at reducing vulnerabilities \nto natural hazards. The Hyogo Framework for \nAction 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of \nNations and Communities to Disasters, adopted \nat the World Conference on Disaster Reduction, \nhighlights knowledge and education as one of the \nfive main priorities of action. Attention should be \naccorded and support given to efforts targeting \nschool children and youth with the aim of making \npeople more aware of the threat of hazards and \nof the need and possibility to become better \nprepared before disasters strike.\nTowards this end, Government of India has \napproved a National School Safety Programme \n- a Demonstration Project to be implemented \nby National Disaster Management Authority  \n     To promote a culture of disaster \npreparedness in the school\n• To initiate policy level changes for ensuring\nsafe school environment.\n• To sensitize children and the school \ncommunity on disaster preparedness and \nsafety measures.\n• To motivate direct participation of key \nstakeholders in activities that would \nhelp building towards a disaster resilient \ncommunity.\n• To promote capacity building of officials, \nteachers and students.\n• To carry out Information, Education and \nCommunication (IEC) activities in schools and \nassociated environment.\n• To implement non-structural mitigation \nmeasures in select schools.\n• To carry out demonstrative structural \nretrofitting in select  schools.\nBackground\nVision\nObjective\n(NDMA) in partnership with Ministry of Human \nResource \nDevelopment \n(MHRD) \n, \nState/\nUT Governments, National and International \nAgencies in 43 districts of 22 States /UTs of the \ncountry falling in seismic zone IV & V .",

It recognizes \nthat “every person below the age of eighteen \nyears as a child and that childhood is an integral \npart of life with a value of own, and long term, \nsustainable, \nmulti-sectoral, \nintegrated, \nand \ninclusive approach is necessary for the harmonious \ndevelopment and protection of our children”. The \nPolicy has identified survival, health, nutrition, \neducation, development, protection (including \nfrom emergencies/disasters) and participation as \nthe undeniable rights of every child, and has also \ndeclared these as key priority areas. \nNational Disaster Management Act (2005): \nThe National Disaster Management Act 2005 \nlays down the institutional, legal, financial \nand \ncoordination \nmechanisms \nfor \nDisaster \nManagement (DM) at the national, state, \ndistrict and local levels. Through the National \nInstitute of Disaster Management, the Act \nenvisages promotion of safety awareness among \nstakeholders including teachers and students.\nNational Policy on Disaster Management \n(NPDM), 2009: The National Policy on Disaster \nManagement 2009 highlights the need for \nstructural as well as non- structural safety in \nschools and educational institutions. In the \nchapter on Techno-legal Regime, in section 6.4.1, \nthe Policy identifies school buildings as a national \npriority and enables provision for designing the \nschool buildings/hostels with earthquake resilient \nfeatures and equip them with appropriate fire \nsafety measures. In the chapter on capacity \ndevelopment under section 10.2.2, the policy \nalso emphasizes upon disaster management \ntraining in all educational institutions including \nschools. Section 10.5.1 makes a reference to the \nrole of National Cadet Corps (NCC) and scouts \nand guides in schools and colleges for disaster \nmanagement related work. Section 10.6.1 of \nNPDM discusses the introduction of subject of \ndisaster management in the curriculum through \nthe Central and State Boards of Secondary \nEducation. \nNational Policy on Education (NPE) 1968, \nRevised in 1992, the National Policy on \nEducation calls for a \"child-centred approach\" \nin primary education, but does not contain a \nspecific reference to school safety or disaster risk \nissues of children.\nRight to Education Act 2009: Right to Education \n(RTE) Act 2009 guarantees free and compulsory \neducation to all the children in the country till \nthe age of 14. The Act sets minimum norms and \nstandards with regard to location and quality \nof schools and in Clause 19, lays down that no \nschool shall be established, or recognized unless \nit fulfils the norms and standards specified in the \nschedule. One of the key standards is in relation \nto access to “all weather buildings”; in “areas \nwith difficult terrain, risk of landslides, floods, \nlack of roads and in general, danger for young \nchildren in the approach…the State Government \n/ Local Authority shall locate the school in such a \nmanner as to avoid such dangers”. The Act lays \ndown the formation of the School Management \nCommittee for planning of infrastructure and \nother requirements with respect to operational \nfunctioning of schools. The School Development \nPlan, as laid out by the Act, spells out the  \nphysical requirements of additional infrastructure \nand equipments to meet the norms spelt out in \nthe schedule (in relation to all weather buildings). \nThe RTE Rules provide detailed guidance on \nimplementation of the Act on the ground.\n1.4 \nScope of the Guidelines:\nThe National School Safety Policy Guidelines \ndraw the attention of the decision makers on \nschool education in India (both government and \nprivate) upon the urgent need to strengthen risk \nresilience of schools in rural as well as urban areas \nof the country. It is hoped that this document will \nbe useful for these institutions to ensure that all \nschool children across the country remain safe \nfrom any kind of disaster risk as they access their \nright to education.\n3. Ahmedabad Action Agenda for School Safety, Outcome \ndocument of the International Conference on School \nSafety, 18th - 20th January, 2007, Ahmedabad, India\nSection 1",
      "7\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\n2.1 \nVision\nThe National School Safety Policy Guidelines \napply to all schools in the country – whether \ngovernment, aided or private, irrespective of their \nlocation in rural or urban areas. They apply to all \nstakeholders involved in delivery of education to \nchildren in India. The Guidelines stand for a vision \nof India where all children and their teachers, \nand other stakeholders in the school community \nare safe from any kind of preventable risks \ndue to natural hazards that may threaten their \nwell-being during the pursuit of education. The \nguidelines also actively promote that educational \ncontinuity is maintained / resumed even in \nthe immediate aftermath of a disaster so that \nchildren are physically, mentally and emotionally \nsecure within their schools. Right to Education \nis a fundamental right enshrined in the \nConstitution of India. In order to facilitate \naccess of all children in the country with respect \nto the Right to Education, it is important to \nensure that children remain safe as they access \nand enjoy their Right to Education. \n2.2 \nKey Challenges for Safe Schools\nEfforts on school safety at the National and State \nlevels are at an evolving stage. Key challenges in \nimplementation of school safety measures include: \n●\t\nDisconnect \nbetween \ninstitutions: \nThere is a visible disconnect between the \n‘non-emergency’ schemes (Pertaining to \nEducation) such as Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan \nand Disaster response / preparedness. \nEducation programmes are executed in \nmost states with little synergy or policy \nlinkages with the SDMA / DDMA.\n●\t\nLimited \nconvergence \nbetween \nschemes: Resources required for effective \nimplementation of a govt. scheme cannot \nbe leveraged in the absence of a mechanism \nfor collaborative working with other budget \nholders. For instance, land development \nwithin the school campus may be funded \nthrough Mahatma Gandhi National Rural \nEmployment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). \nHowever, close coordination between micro \nplanning activity for MGNREGA and School \nDevelopment Plan preparation would be \nnecessary for convergence.\n●\t\nLimited \nunderstanding \nof \nschool \nsafety concept: It is evident that the \nexisting \neducation \nmachinery \nin \nthe \ncountry is keen to promote safe learning \nenvironment for children and teachers but \nactual implementation of programmes on \nground points to limited understanding of \nthe concept of safety. At best, new school \ndesigns incorporate earthquake safety \nfeatures in many areas; however floods, \ncyclones, landslides have been given little \nattention in design and costing of schools. \nIn addition non-structural elements are \noften not understood as threats to safety. \nAt the level of teachers and students, safety \nissues are discussed and pursued as one off \nactivities. School timetable and curriculum \nneed suitable modifications to make safety \nunderstanding a routine activity.\nThe National School Safety Policy Guidelines \nemphasize on the need for active mainstreaming \nof disaster risk reduction in all the school education \ninitiatives in the country. This would require \na collaborative approach between the state \neducation departments and the state disaster \nmanagement machinery. Collaboration, would be \nnecessary especially for capacity development \nactivities such as sensitization of officials, public \nawareness on disasters, training of students \nand teachers; pre-positioning equipments for \nemergency response, creation of educational \nmaterial on disasters and, monitoring of risk.\nVision, Approach and  \nObjectives of the Guidelines\n2\nSection 2",
      "8\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\n2.3 \nApproach to Implementation\nFundamental principles that form the core \napproach of these guidelines are given below:\n2.3.1  All hazard approach\nSchool Safety efforts need to take cognizance \nof all kinds of hazards that may affect the well-\nbeing of children. These may include natural \nhazards such as floods and earthquakes as well \nas manmade hazards. Hazards include structural \nand non- structural factors. Structural factors \ninclude dilapidated buildings, poorly designed \nstructures, faulty construction, poorly maintained \ninfrastructure, loose building elements, etc. while \nnon structural factors include loosely placed \nheavy objects such as almirahs, infestation of the \ncampus by snakes and any other pests, broken \nor no boundary walls, uneven flooring, blocked \nevacuation routes, poorly designed and placed \nfurniture that may cause accidents and injury, \ninadequate sanitation facilities etc. Safety of \nchildren, their teachers and parents needs to be \napproached holistically to include visible as well \nas invisible risks that may be sudden on-set or \nhave built-up slowly over a period of time.\n2.3.2  Strengthening \nexisting \npolicy \nprovisions to make schools safer\nThere has been substantial investment by the \nGovernment in creating infrastructure for the \neducation sector. There is need to ensure that all \nthe existing and new infrastructure is resilient to \nlocally relevant hazards through the design and \nconstruction processes. Unsafe structures can \nincrease the vulnerability of children who are the \nprimary target group of such efforts. Thus it is \nimportant to ensure that all development actions \ntaken even in non-emergency times are designed \nwith a view to ensuring their performance during \nemergencies.\nIt is imperative that the existing institutions at \nthe national and state level are strengthened \nand capacitated to take responsibility of school \nsafety planning and action. Such a step will \nnot only ensure that development policies and \nprogrammes are strengthened but also provide \nthe necessary succor to safety actions.\n2.3.3  School Safety as an indicator of \nquality for planning, execution and \nmonitoring \nSchool Safety is not a onetime effort but a \ncontinuous process. Safety principles need to be \nincorporated in the day to day functioning of the \neducational institutions in the country, cutting \nacross the traditional stages of the disaster \ncycle: preparedness, response and recovery. \nThus institutions involved in providing education \nin the country need to evolve a methodology and \nan approach of their own that looks at safety as a \ncontinuously monitored indicator of quality.\n2.4  \nObjectives \nof \nthe \nPolicy \nGuidelines\nThe primary objective of the National School \nSafety Policy Guidelines is to ensure the  \ncreation of safe learning environment for children. \nThe Policy Guidelines also seek to highlight \nspecific actions towards school safety that can be \nundertaken by different stakeholders within the \nexisting framework for delivery of education.\nSection 2",
      "14\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nSSA also mentions, “..School Development Plan \nshould emerge from a process of micro planning \nundertaken \nin \na \nparticipatory \nmanner..The \npreparation of the School Development Plan may \nbe undertaken by a core team, led by a School \nManagement Committee member from the village/\nhabitation, and comprising selected community \nleaders, NGO representatives, Head Teacher, \nselected teachers and parents, especially parents \nof children from disadvantaged groups and \nweaker sections, and children with special needs... \nand would include, inter alia.. preparation of a \nproposal for improved education facilities..” (SSA \nFramework for Implementation, 2009, pp 137)\nIn parallel, the plan also needs to be consulted/ \nbrought in picture with the village Panchayat \nfor exploring opportunities for leveraging other \nschemes.\n3.2.3 \nSchool Disaster Management Plan\nSchools \nshould \nalso \ndevelop \na \nDisaster \nManagement \nPlan \ndefining \nprocedures \nto \nconfine, contain, consolidate and control the \nemergency and crisis, with inputs from DDMA.\nThis plan should include among other aspects, \nsystem of warnings, communication protocols \nwithin and outside the school (including usage \nof public addressal system), identification of \nevacuation routes, access by emergency vehicles \nand care of children with special needs. The \nDisaster Management Plan should also include \nstock piling of emergency equipment and \nmaterials, regular maintenance of emergency \nequipment, arrangements for orderly release \nof students to guardians and temporary shelter, \nin case required. A site map should be included \nin the plan, designating planned evacuation \nroutes and assembly areas. The same should be \ndisplayed on each floor of the school. A copy of \nthe plot map and floor plan for each school with \nthese details should be submitted to the DDMA \nfor inclusion in the DDMP.\n3.3 \nImplementation \nof \nsafety \nactions\n3.3.1 \nAppropriate Siting, Design and \ndetailing for structural safety in new \nschools and repairing of existing \nschools\nAll existing as well as new schools need to \nconform to safety standards as per the National \nBuilding Code. In addition, any other norms \nprescribed by the state government need to be \nadhered to. (Refer Annexure 6)\nSome of these actions are given below:\n● \nNew schools should be located, on a site \nthat has adequate mitigation measures \nalready in place against any imminent \nnatural hazards. Existing schools located \nin a vulnerable location should either be \nrelocated at a safer site or they should \nbe provided adequate support to mitigate \nthe effect of any natural hazards that may \naffect the area.\n● \nAll \nnew \nschool \nconstructions \nshould \ninclude disaster resilient features. Existing \nvulnerable schools need to be repaired to \nthe desired level of resilience with regard \nto local disaster risks.\n● \nPrescribed designs may be adapted to \naccommodate safety and child friendly \nfeatures.\n● \nFor design of structural standards of school \nbuilding and its components such as \ncorridors, staircases, side areas, quality of \nconstruction should be as per the National \nBuilding Code 2005. Only non-combustible, \nfire-proof, heat resistant materials shall be \nused in school construction.\n● \nVertical expansion of existing schools \nshall not be carried out without a fitness \ncertificate for the building from a certified \ncivil / structural engineer.\n● \nAdditional \nclassrooms \nor \nany \nother \nstructures requiring horizontal expansion \nshall be designed taking into account the \nspace availability and while constructing as \na continuous unit to the existing structures, \nthese should be designed to have less \nimpact of seismic forces.\n● \nEach class room should have two doors \nfor easy evacuation; adequate openings \nfor ventilation and lighting are some of \nthe essential elements that need to be \naccommodated in the design.\n● \nDoors opening outside, into open areas or \ncorridors of adequate width are key details \nthat need to be incorporated to make \nschools safer. \nSection 3",
      "21\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nRight of school children to a safe learning \nenvironment cannot be upheld by only one \ninstitution. The National Policy on Disaster \nManagement reinforces that disaster management \nis everyone’s business; a single individual or \nagency cannot, on their own be responsible for \nsafeguarding the interest of the future generation. \nThere is a need for a more practical linkage \nbetween the national, state and local governance \nstructures so that the overall well- being of \nchildren and teachers as well as their families can \nbe promoted. Moreover, these structures need to \nwork together along with the school community to \nnot only address primary risks (floods, earthquake, \netc.) but also underlying risks and vulnerabilities \nto singularly define ‘safety’ as a quality issue in \neducation facilities whether government, aided or \nprivately owned.\nThe \nroles \nand \nresponsibilities \nof \ndifferent \nstakeholders are given below:\n4.1 \nState Disaster Management \nAuthorities (SDMAs):\n● \nCollaborate with and involve education \nauthorities \nin \nDM \nplanning, \npolicies, \nprocesses and in developing minimum \nstandards for school safety before, during \nand after emergencies. This can be done by \nco-opting the State Project Director of SSA \nand / any other officials / NGOs / Private \nagencies as part of the SEC of the SDMA.\n● \nEnsure that school safety is given due \nattention in the SDMPs.\n● \nCollaborate with and provide training inputs \nto Department of Education for integration \nof DRR education in formal curriculum of \nschools.\n● \nCollaborate with and provide training inputs \nto Department of Education for training \nof School Safety Focal point teachers and \nSchool Management Committee members \nto lead school safety efforts in their \nrespective schools.\n4.2 \nDistrict Disaster Management \nAuthorities (DDMAs):\n● \nCollaborate with and involve education \nauthorities \nin \nDM \nplanning, \npolicies, \nprocesses \nand \ndeveloping \nminimum \nstandards for school safety before, during \nand after emergencies. This can be done \nby co-opting the District Education Officer \nand / any other officials / NGOs / Private \nagencies as part of the DDMA.\n● \nDDMAs need to make sure that school safety \nis given due attention in the DDMPs.\n● \nCollaborate with and provide training inputs \nto Department of Education for training of \nSchool Safety Focal point teachers and School \nManagement Committee members to lead \nschool safety efforts in their respective schools.\n● \nEnsure that all school buildings whether \ngovernment or private, comply with the \nbuilding codes and directives of the Hon’ble \nSupreme Court of India in relation to safety \nof children.\n● \nFacilitate specialised training in schools for \nteachers and peer educators.\n● \nInclude issues of school safety –in the \nDistrict Disaster Management Plans.\n● \nConduct periodic mock drills at the district \nlevel actively involving schools.\n4.3 \nNational \nlevel \nEducation \nAuthorities:\n● \nProvide necessary guidance and resources \nfor infrastructure that is disaster resistant \nRoles and Responsibilities of \nStakeholders\n4\nSection 4",
      "35\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nAnnexure – 1\nSnapshot on the number of deaths and damage to school infrastructure in \nDisaster – Global and National\nThere have been several instances of children losing their lives or suffering serious injuries due to \nvarious natural disasters. In 2008 Haiti earthquake, half of the schools in the country was destroyed \n(Reliefweb 2008). The Sichuan Earthquake in 2008 caused collapse of over 7,000 school buildings \n(Reliefweb, 2008).  The 2005 Kashmir earthquake resulted in collapse of over 8000 schools on both \nsides of the border; altogether over 18000 children lost their lives while at school (BBC 2005).\nA fire led to the death of about 200 children at the prize giving ceremony at a school in Dabwali, \nHaryana in 1995; a total of 31 teachers died and 95 were injured.  During the 2001 Gujarat Earthquake \nover 11,600 schools were destroyed/ damaged; 971 students perished and 1,051 were injured. \n(World Bank 2001). Similarly the fire at Lord Krishna School in Kumbakonam, Tamilnadu caused \ndeath of 94 children and thousands of students and teachers were impacted in South India in the \naftermath of the 2004 Tsunami.\nCause for such state of affairs has largely been poor quality of construction, lack of disaster \nresilient features and poor maintenance of schools. The fact remains that schools are indeed \nspaces where children and teachers spend a large part of their day. Therefore the quality of these \nspaces has a bearing on their vulnerability to disaster risk.\nAnnexures\nAnnexure",

Since 2009, the EFC note to be submitted by all \nministries includes a well defined set of questions with regard to disaster management. \nThe SSA Framework for Implementation has been revised in light of the RTE Act and a \ndedicated chapter on School Infrastructure has been provided. The chapter clearly brings out \nthe need and importance of Disaster Resistance in Schools and also gives norms and codes to be \nreferred.\nFurther, Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan Institutions have specified the space norms and appropriate \nsizes for school classrooms etc. in Kendriya Vidyalaya schools that are administered by the \nSangathan. \nRashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) guides the expansion strategy for Secondary \nSchools & Higher Secondary Schools. To provide access to secondary school for students, RMSA \nproposes up-gradation of upper primary schools through construction of classrooms laboratories, \ncomputer rooms, headmaster room, library rooms, separate toilets for girls and boys, appointment \nof additional teachers and strengthening of existing secondary schools. This scheme identifies \nEnvironment Management as an important aspect for improving quality and improving access \nof secondary education. It makes a reference to location/site selection related issues, and \nissues related to design pertaining to the difficult sites. RMSA also makes a reference to special \npurpose designs, construction related impacts, and issues related to provision and maintenance \nof facilities.\nKasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas (KGBV) scheme was launched by the Government of \nIndia in August, 2004 for setting up residential schools at upper primary level for girls belonging \npredominantly to the SC, ST, OBC and minorities in difficult areas. Initially it ran as a separate \nscheme, but was merged with the SSA with effect from 1st April, 2007. With the RTE Act, 2009 \ncoming into force with effect from 1st April 2010, and the SSA Framework of Implementation \nbeing revised to correspond to the RTE Act, the KGBV component of SSA is being implemented \nAnnexure",
      "38\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nin the overall context of child rights and child entitlements and in harmony with the spirit and \nstipulations of the Act. \nNational Building Code of India (NBC), published by Bureau of Indian Standards in 2005 serves \nas a Model Code for adoption by all agencies involved in school construction works. The Code \nattributes an ‘importance factor’ to ascertain the structural design of different types of building, \ndepending on the functional use of the structure, characterised by hazardous consequences of its \nfailure, its post-earthquake functional need, historic value, or economic importance. In section \n5.3.4, the Code attributes Importance Factor of 1.5 to Schools, higher than all other buildings \nindicating the importance of schools. \nHon’ble Supreme Court of India has also come out with its judgment in support of school safety, \nand insisted on adherence to NBC standards in school building specifications and construction. \nIn its judgment of April13, 2009 on Writ Petition (Civil)no. 483 of 2004, the court has recognized \nthat “Right to education incorporates the provision of safer schools” and given direction on several \naspects of school safety including : \na) \nFire Safety Measures in Schools (Point 3.1 page 23)\nb) \nTraining of School Teachers and other Staff (Point 3.2 page 25)\nc) \nSchool Building Specifications (Point 3.3 page 27)\nd) \nClearances & Certificates (Point 3.4 page 29)\nIn response to Writ Petition (Civil) no.483 of 20044 , the court held that “Evaluation of structural \naspect of the school may be carried out periodically…the concerned engineers and officials must \nstrictly follow the National Building Code. The safety certificate be issued only after proper \ninspection. Dereliction in duty must attract immediate disciplinary action against the concerned \nofficials.”\nIn addition to policy interest in addressing structural aspects of safety, there have been changes \nin the school curriculum as well. The SSA, Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and state \nboards have introduced disaster education in curriculum for school education. \nThe most recent initiative by the government was the National School Safety Project \nimplemented by NDMA in 43 districts of 22 states of the country.

The school may comprise of the following \nteams/task forces.\ni. \nAwareness Generation, Warning and information dissemination team.\nii. \nEvacuation team.\niii. \nSearch and rescue team (only teachers to be member of this team)\niv. \nFire safety team\nv. \nFirst aid team.\nvi. \nBus safety team (for each bus) - wherever applicable.\nvii. \nSite security team.\nGuidance Note:\nThis section of the plan will focus on Preparedness. Higher Level of preparedness for disaster helps to \nminimise the loss of life and prevention of injures caused particularly during earthquakes for which \nthere is no warning. However certain other hazards like flood, cyclone etc. do have early warning \nsystem thereby giving some time for taking response. Children being the future of tomorrow should be \nensured a safe learning environment and prepared well to respond effectively during disasters. To put \nthis into practice it is recommended that every school constitutes a School Level Disaster Management \nCommittee along with sub committees to ensure better preparedness and response in disasters. The \nvarious committees constituted in a school will comprise of members from among teachers, non \nteaching staff as well students. However for certain committee like search and rescue students are not \nrecommended. The recommended structure for a School Disaster Management Committee is as follows:\n1. \nChairperson: Principal\n2. \nVice Principal, Heads of primary and middle sections\n3. \nEducation Officer/Deputy Education Officer for the zone\n4. \nParent Teacher Association President\n5. \n4 Students (NCC, NSS, Scouts and Guides, Head Boy and Head Girl)\n6. \nRepresentative \nof \nRelief/ \nRevenue/ \nDisaster \nManagement \nDepartment/ \nDistrict \nAdministration/ Municipal Corporation\n7. \nRepresentative of the Fire Services (from Closest Fire Station) or Civil defence personnel.\n8. \nRepresentative of Police (from Closest Police Station)\n9. \nRepresentative of Health Department (Local Doctor)\n10. \nA Warden from Civil Defence\nThe sub committees mentioned below will work under overall supervision of school DM Committee \n(SDMC).

(Delivery of education during and \npost disaster situation particularly in cases where the school will be used as relief shelters).\nc. \nReporting of Emergencies/ Disasters to the Government\nd. \nSpecial provision for specially abled children.\nGuidance Note:\nThis section of the plan should be very precise, crisp indicating the various roles and responsibilities \nof teachers, non teaching staff and students during disaster situation. The plan should clearly mention \nthe steps to be followed in case of an earthquake, fire, flooding, cyclone or such emergent situation like \nstampede or health problems faced by any student. The plan should include all the steps to be taken \nup by the school management to ensure safety of the child including their safe evacuation from the \naffected site till the child is handed over to the parents. It will also include all other steps to be taken \nup by the management to ensure supply of essential services in the school like power, water and food \nand basic first aid during a disaster and immediately after it.\nSection 5 : Mitigation measures\na. \nListing of various Non-structural measures to be undertaken in the school along with \ntimeline.\ni. \nEnsuring clear passages, stairways which are to be used as evacuation routes.\nii. \nChemistry labs-the bottles used for storing the chemicals are secured and protected against \nshattering.\niii. \nFixating of Almirahs to the walls of staff rooms.\niv. \nSecuring fans and light from ceiling.\nv. \nFire safety measures\nb. \nSafety audit\ni. \nElectric safety audit-checking of the electrical system by an electrician.\nii. \nFire safety audit-checking for possible sources of fire and identifying inflammable items \nwithin the school\niii. \nInspection of quality of food getting served during mid-day meal.\niv. \nAudit of purity of water supply in school.\nv. \nInspection of the hygienic conditions in kitchen and washrooms.\nGuidance Note:\nThis section of the plan will focus on various mitigation measures to be undertaken by the school. \nMitigation Planning is a long term exercise and hence it is essential to divide the strategy prioritizing \nthe actions along with definite timeline. It is also necessary to prioritise the actions based on the \nnature of the threat and its potential to cause injuries and loss of life. Some of the non structural \nmitigation measure like anchorage of almirahs, clearance of the exit routes, relocation of the storage \nof laboratory items, installation of warning alarms could be done immediately by incurring minimal \ncosts, some other mitigation measures like major structural repair work will require more time and \nfund commitments.\nAs a part of mitigation action, school should also undertake periodic fire and electrical safety checks \nby involving officials from Electricity Department/ board, Fire Services, PWD etc. Other measures like \ntesting of purity of drinking water and hygienic conditions in the school should also be undertaken.\nAnnexure",

It recognizes \nthat “every person below the age of eighteen \nyears as a child and that childhood is an integral \npart of life with a value of own, and long term, \nsustainable, \nmulti-sectoral, \nintegrated, \nand \ninclusive approach is necessary for the harmonious \ndevelopment and protection of our children”. The \nPolicy has identified survival, health, nutrition, \neducation, development, protection (including \nfrom emergencies/disasters) and participation as \nthe undeniable rights of every child, and has also \ndeclared these as key priority areas. \nNational Disaster Management Act (2005): \nThe National Disaster Management Act 2005 \nlays down the institutional, legal, financial \nand \ncoordination \nmechanisms \nfor \nDisaster \nManagement (DM) at the national, state, \ndistrict and local levels. Through the National \nInstitute of Disaster Management, the Act \nenvisages promotion of safety awareness among \nstakeholders including teachers and students.\nNational Policy on Disaster Management \n(NPDM), 2009: The National Policy on Disaster \nManagement 2009 highlights the need for \nstructural as well as non- structural safety in \nschools and educational institutions. In the \nchapter on Techno-legal Regime, in section 6.4.1, \nthe Policy identifies school buildings as a national \npriority and enables provision for designing the \nschool buildings/hostels with earthquake resilient \nfeatures and equip them with appropriate fire \nsafety measures. In the chapter on capacity \ndevelopment under section 10.2.2, the policy \nalso emphasizes upon disaster management \ntraining in all educational institutions including \nschools. Section 10.5.1 makes a reference to the \nrole of National Cadet Corps (NCC) and scouts \nand guides in schools and colleges for disaster \nmanagement related work. Section 10.6.1 of \nNPDM discusses the introduction of subject of \ndisaster management in the curriculum through \nthe Central and State Boards of Secondary \nEducation. \nNational Policy on Education (NPE) 1968, \nRevised in 1992, the National Policy on \nEducation calls for a \"child-centred approach\" \nin primary education, but does not contain a \nspecific reference to school safety or disaster risk \nissues of children.\nRight to Education Act 2009: Right to Education \n(RTE) Act 2009 guarantees free and compulsory \neducation to all the children in the country till \nthe age of 14. The Act sets minimum norms and \nstandards with regard to location and quality \nof schools and in Clause 19, lays down that no \nschool shall be established, or recognized unless \nit fulfils the norms and standards specified in the \nschedule. One of the key standards is in relation \nto access to “all weather buildings”; in “areas \nwith difficult terrain, risk of landslides, floods, \nlack of roads and in general, danger for young \nchildren in the approach…the State Government \n/ Local Authority shall locate the school in such a \nmanner as to avoid such dangers”. The Act lays \ndown the formation of the School Management \nCommittee for planning of infrastructure and \nother requirements with respect to operational \nfunctioning of schools. The School Development \nPlan, as laid out by the Act, spells out the  \nphysical requirements of additional infrastructure \nand equipments to meet the norms spelt out in \nthe schedule (in relation to all weather buildings). \nThe RTE Rules provide detailed guidance on \nimplementation of the Act on the ground.\n1.4 \nScope of the Guidelines:\nThe National School Safety Policy Guidelines \ndraw the attention of the decision makers on \nschool education in India (both government and \nprivate) upon the urgent need to strengthen risk \nresilience of schools in rural as well as urban areas \nof the country. It is hoped that this document will \nbe useful for these institutions to ensure that all \nschool children across the country remain safe \nfrom any kind of disaster risk as they access their \nright to education.\n3. Ahmedabad Action Agenda for School Safety, Outcome \ndocument of the International Conference on School \nSafety, 18th - 20th January, 2007, Ahmedabad, India\nSection 1",
      "7\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\n2.1 \nVision\nThe National School Safety Policy Guidelines \napply to all schools in the country – whether \ngovernment, aided or private, irrespective of their \nlocation in rural or urban areas. They apply to all \nstakeholders involved in delivery of education to \nchildren in India. The Guidelines stand for a vision \nof India where all children and their teachers, \nand other stakeholders in the school community \nare safe from any kind of preventable risks \ndue to natural hazards that may threaten their \nwell-being during the pursuit of education. The \nguidelines also actively promote that educational \ncontinuity is maintained / resumed even in \nthe immediate aftermath of a disaster so that \nchildren are physically, mentally and emotionally \nsecure within their schools. Right to Education \nis a fundamental right enshrined in the \nConstitution of India. In order to facilitate \naccess of all children in the country with respect \nto the Right to Education, it is important to \nensure that children remain safe as they access \nand enjoy their Right to Education. \n2.2 \nKey Challenges for Safe Schools\nEfforts on school safety at the National and State \nlevels are at an evolving stage. Key challenges in \nimplementation of school safety measures include: \n●\t\nDisconnect \nbetween \ninstitutions: \nThere is a visible disconnect between the \n‘non-emergency’ schemes (Pertaining to \nEducation) such as Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan \nand Disaster response / preparedness. \nEducation programmes are executed in \nmost states with little synergy or policy \nlinkages with the SDMA / DDMA.\n●\t\nLimited \nconvergence \nbetween \nschemes: Resources required for effective \nimplementation of a govt. scheme cannot \nbe leveraged in the absence of a mechanism \nfor collaborative working with other budget \nholders. For instance, land development \nwithin the school campus may be funded \nthrough Mahatma Gandhi National Rural \nEmployment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). \nHowever, close coordination between micro \nplanning activity for MGNREGA and School \nDevelopment Plan preparation would be \nnecessary for convergence.\n●\t\nLimited \nunderstanding \nof \nschool \nsafety concept: It is evident that the \nexisting \neducation \nmachinery \nin \nthe \ncountry is keen to promote safe learning \nenvironment for children and teachers but \nactual implementation of programmes on \nground points to limited understanding of \nthe concept of safety. At best, new school \ndesigns incorporate earthquake safety \nfeatures in many areas; however floods, \ncyclones, landslides have been given little \nattention in design and costing of schools. \nIn addition non-structural elements are \noften not understood as threats to safety. \nAt the level of teachers and students, safety \nissues are discussed and pursued as one off \nactivities. School timetable and curriculum \nneed suitable modifications to make safety \nunderstanding a routine activity.\nThe National School Safety Policy Guidelines \nemphasize on the need for active mainstreaming \nof disaster risk reduction in all the school education \ninitiatives in the country. This would require \na collaborative approach between the state \neducation departments and the state disaster \nmanagement machinery. Collaboration, would be \nnecessary especially for capacity development \nactivities such as sensitization of officials, public \nawareness on disasters, training of students \nand teachers; pre-positioning equipments for \nemergency response, creation of educational \nmaterial on disasters and, monitoring of risk.\nVision, Approach and  \nObjectives of the Guidelines\n2\nSection 2",
      "8\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\n2.3 \nApproach to Implementation\nFundamental principles that form the core \napproach of these guidelines are given below:\n2.3.1  All hazard approach\nSchool Safety efforts need to take cognizance \nof all kinds of hazards that may affect the well-\nbeing of children. These may include natural \nhazards such as floods and earthquakes as well \nas manmade hazards. Hazards include structural \nand non- structural factors. Structural factors \ninclude dilapidated buildings, poorly designed \nstructures, faulty construction, poorly maintained \ninfrastructure, loose building elements, etc. while \nnon structural factors include loosely placed \nheavy objects such as almirahs, infestation of the \ncampus by snakes and any other pests, broken \nor no boundary walls, uneven flooring, blocked \nevacuation routes, poorly designed and placed \nfurniture that may cause accidents and injury, \ninadequate sanitation facilities etc. Safety of \nchildren, their teachers and parents needs to be \napproached holistically to include visible as well \nas invisible risks that may be sudden on-set or \nhave built-up slowly over a period of time.\n2.3.2  Strengthening \nexisting \npolicy \nprovisions to make schools safer\nThere has been substantial investment by the \nGovernment in creating infrastructure for the \neducation sector. There is need to ensure that all \nthe existing and new infrastructure is resilient to \nlocally relevant hazards through the design and \nconstruction processes. Unsafe structures can \nincrease the vulnerability of children who are the \nprimary target group of such efforts. Thus it is \nimportant to ensure that all development actions \ntaken even in non-emergency times are designed \nwith a view to ensuring their performance during \nemergencies.\nIt is imperative that the existing institutions at \nthe national and state level are strengthened \nand capacitated to take responsibility of school \nsafety planning and action. Such a step will \nnot only ensure that development policies and \nprogrammes are strengthened but also provide \nthe necessary succor to safety actions.\n2.3.3  School Safety as an indicator of \nquality for planning, execution and \nmonitoring \nSchool Safety is not a onetime effort but a \ncontinuous process. Safety principles need to be \nincorporated in the day to day functioning of the \neducational institutions in the country, cutting \nacross the traditional stages of the disaster \ncycle: preparedness, response and recovery. \nThus institutions involved in providing education \nin the country need to evolve a methodology and \nan approach of their own that looks at safety as a \ncontinuously monitored indicator of quality.\n2.4  \nObjectives \nof \nthe \nPolicy \nGuidelines\nThe primary objective of the National School \nSafety Policy Guidelines is to ensure the  \ncreation of safe learning environment for children. \nThe Policy Guidelines also seek to highlight \nspecific actions towards school safety that can be \nundertaken by different stakeholders within the \nexisting framework for delivery of education.\nSection 2",
      "11\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\n3.1 \nStrengthening \nInstitutional \nCommitment to Safe Learning \nEnvironment for Children \nThe first and foremost step in promoting safety \nof learning spaces is to sensitize and strengthen \nofficial structures and mechanisms responsible \nfor safety at the State, District and Local levels. \n3.1.1 \nInstitutional Strengthening at the \nState and District Level\nThe institutional and regulatory framework as \nlaid down in the various National Acts provides \nfor realizing the Right to Education as well \nas Disaster Management in the country. For \nensuring that students and their teachers remain \nsafe in pursuit of education, it is necessary \nthat the two institutional frameworks act in \nconvergence with each other, through the \nphases of preparedness, response and recovery. \nThe Right to Education Act (RTE) guarantees free \nand compulsory education to all the children in \nthe country till the age of 14 based on minimum \nnorms and standards that are mandatory for \nany school in the country to be “established, \nor recognized”. It recognizes the need for “all \nweather buildings” and limitations posed by \ndifficulty of terrain, risk of landslides, floods, \nlack of roads and in general, danger for young \nchildren in approach etc.\nThe RTE Act thus serves as a strong base for \npromoting school safety. The framework for \nimplementation of RTE-SSA has a strong focus \non Disaster Management\nThe National Disaster Management Act, 2005 \nmandates \nthe \nState \nDisaster \nManagement \nAuthorities (SDMA) to provide guidelines for \ndifferent departments to integrate disaster \nprevention and mitigation measures in their \ndevelopment \nplans \nand \nprovide \nnecessary \ntechnical assistance thereof. The SDMA needs to \nwork closely with the State Education Department \nto support the school safety efforts at the state \nlevel.\nThere is a need to co-opt senior officials of the \nDepartment of Education at the State and the \nDistrict level as part of the State and District \nDisaster Management Authorities for promotion \nof safe schools. In addition, a School Safety \nAdvisory Committee may be formed to advise \nthe education department on the subject.\nThis will ensure that school safety can be \npractically promoted through convergent action \nby the SDMA / DDMA and the education machinery \nat the state and district level. \nAs a direct consequence of this institutional \ndovetailing / convergence, the state and district \ndisaster management plans will include a focus \non educational infrastructure and supportive \naction thereof, such as status of education \ninfrastructure from a risk resilience perspective, \ncapacity building of different stakeholders on \nsafety aspects, and large scale awareness on \ndisasters among students and the community at \nlarge. In parallel, the education machinery also \nneeds to strengthen their efforts with respect to \npromoting school safety for government, aided \nas well as private schools.\nThe District Education Officer must ensure that \n‘Recognition Certificate’ under sub-rule (4) 15 \nof Right of Children to Free and Compulsory \nEducation Rules, 2010 is issued only to those \nschools that comply with safety norms laid out \nin the Building Codes. This compliance needs to \nbe monitored on a regular basis.\nIn addition, a mechanism needs to be evolved \nby the District Education Officer and designated \nRegulatory Authorities for monitoring safety \nparameters in all schools on a regular basis. Any \nexisting monitoring formats being used by the \nAuthorities shall essentially include parameters \non school safety as well.\nAction Areas\n3\nSection 3",

For private and unaided \nschools, the National Accreditation Board for \nEducation and Training needs to monitor safety \naspects. In addition, as per the DM Act, DDMA \nneeds to monitor all school buildings for their \ncompliance with building codes.\nFor schools under SSA, the current process \nof preparation of annual School Development \nPlans needs to reinforce focus on safety \naspects. \nA \ncomprehensive \nassessment \nof \nneeds, conducted prior to the development of \nthe School Development Plan (SDP) is essential \nfor identifying the possible risks for children as \nwell as their capabilities to respond and recover \nfrom critical incidents. The assessment should \nconsider the history of natural disaster risk in \nthe area and natural vulnerabilities, physical \nfactors, such as the location of the school with \nregard to existing / emerging hazards, for \nexample flooding due to proximity of a water \nbody, building code requirements in relation \nto school structures as well as non-structural \ncomponents that may threaten the well-being \nof children. It should also consider emergency \nuses of the school facility such as, school being \ndesignated as a relief shelter in the District \nDisaster Management Plans.\nThe School Management Committee members, \nchildren and teachers being the primary users \nof the school are in the best position to identify \nand plan for addressing hazards and risks that \nmay threaten their safety. Once the School \nManagement Committee has been formed and \noriented to school safety issues, a dedicated group \nof individuals is available to lead the process of \nidentifying risks and vulnerabilities. \nAny appropriate tool may be used to conduct the \nprocess of identifying needs in a participatory \nmanner. For instance, ‘Hazard hunt’ exercise is a \ntested method to identify risks, both inside and \noutside the school precincts that may threaten \nthe safety of the school community. It involves \nidentifying all kinds of hazards including those that \ncan cause physical harm such as deep potholes, \nlack of boundary walls; those that affect the \nhealth of children such as contaminated water \nsources, absence of toilets and hand washing \nfacilities; as well those factors that are outside \nthe school per se such as fast moving traffic on \nthe road outside, ponds etc. (Refer Annexure 7)\nBased on the assessment of needs, the School \nDevelopment Plan needs to be prepared by the \nSchool Management Committee. NDMA through \nSDMA and DDMA will provide standard tool kits \nand render other inputs to facilitate the process. \n(Format of School DM Plan is available as \nAnnexure 8)\nThe plan would comprise measures to be taken \nboth within school premises and in the immediate \nneighborhood including:\n1. \nShort term interventions : both non-\nstructural and structural activities\n2. \nLong- term interventions : both non-\nstructural and structural activities\n3. \nTraining plan: For students and teachers \n4. \nKnowledge \nbuilding \nplan \nincluding \nawareness creation, mass sensitization, \nmock-drills including follow up through \nregular school timetable.

To provide access to secondary school for students, RMSA \nproposes up-gradation of upper primary schools through construction of classrooms laboratories, \ncomputer rooms, headmaster room, library rooms, separate toilets for girls and boys, appointment \nof additional teachers and strengthening of existing secondary schools. This scheme identifies \nEnvironment Management as an important aspect for improving quality and improving access \nof secondary education.

Higher Level of preparedness for disaster helps to \nminimise the loss of life and prevention of injures caused particularly during earthquakes for which \nthere is no warning. However certain other hazards like flood, cyclone etc. do have early warning \nsystem thereby giving some time for taking response. Children being the future of tomorrow should be \nensured a safe learning environment and prepared well to respond effectively during disasters. To put \nthis into practice it is recommended that every school constitutes a School Level Disaster Management \nCommittee along with sub committees to ensure better preparedness and response in disasters. The \nvarious committees constituted in a school will comprise of members from among teachers, non \nteaching staff as well students.

The same were communicated to the government.\n8.2  The Hon’ble Chief Minister, in an announcement dated 07.12.2015, among other things \nordered for exemption from payment of fees for obtaining copies and duplicate of documents \n(Driving Licence, R.C. Books, etc.) by those who lost them due to heavy ﬂ ood in Chennai, \nThiruvallur, Kamcheepuram and Cuddalore districts (Annexure I).\nCamps for Lost Documents/Certiﬁ cates\n8.3  The Government also directed ofﬁ cials to conduct special camps for two weeks beginning \n14.12.2015 in which various State Government Departments and Central Government \nOrganisations were to participate and receive applications from the affected public and \nissue necessary copies of documents within a week without collecting any fee. This order \nwas applicable for the ﬂ ood-affected people of Chennai, Kancheepuram, Thiruvallur and \nCuddalore districts only and was to stay in force till the completion of the special camps for \nissue of the above said copies/duplicate documents. Subsequently, the issue of duplicate \ndocuments was initiated free of cost (Annexure VII).\n8.4  Camps for issuing duplicate documents were planned for 14-day duration i.e. from December \n14 to 28, 2015. These camps were run from 8 AM to 6 PM. Principal Secretary (Admn.) was \nappointed as the monitoring ofﬁ cer and other IAS ofﬁ cers were appointed as nodal ofﬁ cers \nto ensure smooth functioning of these camps. Special camps were organised at the Taluka \nlevel for issue of certiﬁ cates to persons who lost them in the ﬂ oods. Arrangements were \nalso made to receive applications for replacement of such documents at Common Service \nCentres. Formats of Applications for various documents are at Annexure VIII to XIII.\n8.5  Affected people had to apply for issuance of duplicate documents in the camps in requisite \nformats, which were made widely available. No FIRs for the lost documents were required \nto be ﬁ led. Applications were to be compulsorily made on standardised bilingual application \nforms, which were given to the applicants free of cost. Applications submitted thus were \nacknowledged (on a card), thoroughly veriﬁ ed by the respective departments and duplicates \nwere issued within two weeks. Individuals were informed on their mobile numbers to collect \ncopies of duplicate certiﬁ cates/ documents on their becoming ready for delivery.\n8.6  A decentralised decision-making approach was adopted by nodal ofﬁ cers for taking on-the-\nspot decisions.\nHighlight of the visit-Major Observation\n8\n\n10\n8.7  All government departments, particularly eleven major departments – Revenue, Civil \nSupplies, Census, Banks, Registration, Corporation of Chennai, Oil Corporation, Transport, \nSchool Education, District Differently Abled Welfare Ofﬁ ce (DDAWO) and Industrial \nTraining Institutes (ITIs) of the Department of Technical Education – participated in the \nexercise.\n8.8  Information about these camps was provided to the general public about two weeks in \nadvance. Various modes of communication were used to make them aware about these \ncamps. Auto rickshaw – based speaker announcements were made too, to ensure that the \nmaximum number of affected people make use of these camps.\n8.9  At each of these camps, two reception desks were established for guiding the applicants. \nIn Chennai, a total of 51,654 applications were received for issuing duplicate certiﬁ cates/ \ndocuments (details are at Table 3). All these applications were scrutinized and relevant \ndocuments were provided to the applicants. These camps, conducted in all ﬂ ood-affected \ndistricts, were a major success.\n8.10 In Kancheepuram, a total of 42,810 applications were received in these camps. While a \nmajority of applications (37,001) were successfully disposed, 5,809 applications were \nrejected for want of certain procedural lapses or information mismatch. It may be noted \nhere that out of 5,809 rejected applications, 4,112 were pertaining to Family Card/Ration \nCard (details are at Table 4). A detailed scrutiny of these applications through the data \navailable with the Fair Price Shops under Public Distribution System (PDS) brought out the \nfact that a lot of duplicacy of information had happened. Many applicants had multiple \nration cards and the information provided by them had accuracy issues. Based on the inputs \ngiven by Fair Price Shops, only genuine applicants were issued duplicate ration cards.   \n8.11 College students also raised their concern about their college certiﬁ cates which were lost \nor mutilated due to ﬂ ood water. However, during these camps College certiﬁ cates were not \nissued as it involved different Universities.\n8.12 Village Administrative Ofﬁ cers (VAO) helped people who did not know the survey number/\npatta number. Computers from taluka ofﬁ ces along with printers were brought to the camps \nto help people with the patta numbers.\n8.13 Applications were entertained even if the applicant’s original documents were registered \nin a different taluka. Applications were transmitted to the concerned authority where the \noriginal document was registered, duplicate was obtained and handed over to individuals.\n\n11\n9.1  People/communities living in vulnerable areas should be made aware about the importance of \ntheir certiﬁ cates/documents and the need to store them at safe places.\n9.2 People should be encouraged to link their Government documents to Aadhaar.\n9.3  Develop standard formats for collecting requisite information from applicants. The formats for \nissuing of duplicate copies of various documents used by Government of Tamil Nadu are enclosed \nin annexure for your reference.\n9.4  Establish Common Service Centres at multiple locations for ease of ﬁ ling applications.\n9.5  Documents to be issued on the basis of a certiﬁ cation about the loss to be issued by the concerned \nTehsildar; no need to ﬁ le an FIR to report the loss.\n9.6  Documents should be issued free of cost or at a nominal cost as deemed appropriate.\nTable 3: Details of applications in special camps in Chennai\nS.

The Tamil Nadu Government used the \nopportunity presented to it after the December 2015 deluge to strengthen disaster preparedness \nin the State. A year later, in December 2016, the city was face-to-face with another extreme \nweather event, the tropical Cyclone Vardah. This time around, the government had put in place \npreparedness measures to deal with any freak rainfall, ﬂ ood, cloudburst, drought or cyclonic storm \nincident well in advance. Accordingly, Tamil Nadu SDMA vide Letter No. NC1 (4)/5779/2016, \ndated 04.10.2016 issued an Order to all District Collectors and Greater Chennai Corporation \nwith consolidated instructions to be followed for North East Monsoons 2016 complete with a \ncheck list and formats for reporting the implementation and progress of various measures weekly \n(Annexure XIV). This greatly minimized loss of lives as rescue and evacuation operations could \nbe effectively organized. Massive restoration efforts were launched and the infrastructure was \nbrought back to normalcy within a very short time.\n10.2  Key highlights of the preparedness measures taken to mitigate the impact of Vardah Cyclone and \nNorth East Monsoons during 2016 are as follows:\n• \nSpecial drive to clean channels leading to water tanks is undertaken before the monsoon \nseason.\n• \nGaps between Government and Private Sector efforts were bridged. Private companies came \nforward, post-disaster, for repairing vehicles, re-phasing loans and personnel management.\n• \nThe State Government had convened a meeting with all Stakeholders to discuss their \ncontingency plans which ensured pre-emptive deployment of response forces. Additional \nTeams of NDRF, SDRF and Columns from Army, Navy and Coast Guard were mobilized and \npre-positioned in vulnerable areas.\n• \nSimilar meetings were held at the district and state level to sensitize hospitals, educational \nand industrial organizations, communication service providers and Oil Companies etc. \nsensitizing them to be equipped with institutional strategies for immediate response during \ndisasters. They were also sensitized to make back-up arrangements to ensure continuity of \nlife saving services, especially in the hospitals. \n• \nA coordinated approach covered timely evacuation and minimum casualties. \n• \nPower supplies were turned off during ﬂ oods/cyclonic storms.\n• \nDiesel Generators (DG) were shifted to elevated level/upper ﬂ oors. DG sets of mobile service \noperators were damaged during 2015 ﬂ oods as they were installed in the basements.\n• \nSufﬁ cient diesel/oil stock with power/oil/telecom companies with proper storage facilities \nat safe locations. While only BSNL had enough stock during 2015, each of these service \nproviders had enough stock during the 2016 North East Monsoon.\nApplication of Key Lessons Learnt \n10\n\n15\n• \nDuring the 2016 North East Monsoons, at least 5,000 culverts were cleaned beforehand. \nSimilarly, bridges and culvert outlets were also cleaned – 500 metres upstream and an equal \ndistance downstream.\n• \nAwareness among local communities on Do’s and Don’ts and knowledge of escape routes \nand relief shelters.\n• \nMinisters and Senior Ofﬁ cers were designated for each district/zone during the North East \nMonsoon 2016 to monitor preparedness measures and inter-departmental coordination. \n• \nEducation Department distributed Books/uniforms/other learning aids for school children \nas soon as possible in the relief camps itself, as was done in 2015. This had resulted in \nmaintaining learning outcomes/exam results.\n• \nWhen schools were re-opened after ﬂ oods, water storage tanks were cleaned and ﬁ lled with \nfresh water. \n• \nPower supply to government hospital buildings were restored ﬁ rst. Later, step-by-step \nrestoration of power for other important establishments was done.\n• \nAnimals /cattle were untied during ﬂ ood situations.\n• \nChlorination of water tanks were done before North East Monsoon season.\n• \nVolunteers with skills of swimming and climbing were enrolled as ﬁ rst responders with a \nteam of ten such responders in each vulnerable area. A total of 1499 ﬁ rst responders team \nwere formed. Mobile teams of snake catchers were also formed.\n• \nMassive exercises for desilting 22,899 tanks and 11,446 kms of water bodies were taken up. In \naddition, clearing of blockages on either side of at least 15,870 bridges and more than 1.4 lac \nculverts for up to 500 upstream and downstream were also undertaken and encroachments \nwere removed.\n• \nA total of 6,960 recharge pits were created and 8,657 defunct bore-wells were also converted \nas recharge-pits.\n• \nFormation of green corridors in vulnerable areas to facilitate rapid movement of rescue teams \nto undertake necessary operations.  \n\n16\n11.1  Besides immediate relief measures, Govt. of Tamil Nadu had also undertaken a slew of long-term \nmeasures to prevent the recurrence of a similar disaster situation in the future. These initiatives \naddress the fundamental causes underlying such catastrophes and can easily be contextualized \nfor major cities across the country.\n• \nMaster Plan 2030, drawing lessons from the 2015 deluge, is under preparation. This will \nresult in an institutional framework to manage disasters of such magnitude by way of a long-\nterm plan.\n• \nLong-term conservation and response plans are being drawn.\n• \nRegulation of tanks/reservoirs is being prepared.\n• \nClassiﬁ cation and subsequent mapping of both rural/urban areas to decide their vulnerability \nto ﬂ ooding depending on inundation: 5ft. and above water - high vulnerability; 2-3 ft. water - \nmoderate vulnerability, less than 2 ft. water - low vulnerability. \n• \nPlans to deploy unmanned vehicles (drones) for aerial photography.\n• \nProposal to equip SDRF with cranes of 100 tonnes capacity to remove blockages due to water \nhyacinths.\n• \nUAV photogrammetry of all rivers in rural areas.\n• \nSea-side Storm Surge Modelling.\n• \nStudy the designed discharge capacity of tanks as it may have cascading effects on breaching \nof tanks.\n• \nA compendium of water resources to be made public.\n• \nConstitute Inter-Departmental Teams with Team Leaders for pre-inspection and monitoring \ndesignated areas.\n• \nIdentify escape routes to the nearest relief shelter on vulnerability maps. \n• \nHospitals were asked to prepare their emergency plans.\nOther Measures Taken for Better Preparedness\n11\n\n17\n• \nDo not depend only on ﬁ eld ofﬁ cers for getting information.\n• \nNeed for deployment of boats strategically near vulnerable/low-lying areas during monsoons. \nPre-positioning of lorries and JCBs, etc. too needs to be done in consonance with vulnerability \nof the area.\n• \nNeed to deploy Aapda Mitra at every level for preparedness.\n• \nNeed to train youngsters as ﬁ rst responders. Integration between these ﬁ rst responders and \nofﬁ cial response teams at the local level should be ensured.\n• \nNeed to set up additional emergency operation centres.\n• \nPublic Interest Litigations (PILs) should not be entertained within a speciﬁ ed period (say within \n15-30 days of any such event) to ensure that relief and rescue work are not hampered.\n• \nNeed to maintain all records electronically. In Tamil Nadu, these records are available both \nwith the Revenue and the IT Department.\n• \nOverall infrastructural improvements as preparedness and/or mitigation measure.\n• \nAvailability of multiple-channel HAM radios for uninterrupted communication despite \ncommunication network breakdown during a disaster. Ofﬁ cials/front-line responders/ \ncommunity responders should also be trained on how to use HAM radios.\n• \nDocumentation of best practices.\n• \nNeed to revise Disaster Management Plans.\n• \nRemoval of encroachments on river banks, timely inspection before each monsoon cycle.\n• \nGenerators are needed in all taluka ofﬁ ces for power back up. Water supply also gets disturbed \ndue to lack of power.\n• \nNeed for special cattle ponds to cater to their needs as well as preventing spread of diseases \nthrough community ponds.\n• \nCivil supplies corporations should maintain sufﬁ cient stocks and should be able to move \nthem swiftly whenever needed.\n• \nOnly one designated ofﬁ ce/ofﬁ cer/spokesperson should give out information to the media. \n• \nSoil analysis and land use pattern should be taken into account while planning for urban ﬂ ood \nmitigation in any city/town.\n• \nA policy should be made regarding a standard family kit that will be delivered to the affected \nfamilies in case of a disaster. \n• \nPublic awareness on disasters needs to be created with a community-based participatory \napproach to disaster risk reduction.\n• \nInformation from the Meteorological Department needs to be made user-friendly.\n• \nSuggestive Formats for issuing duplicate copies of various Documents (Annexure XV to \nXVIII).\nSuggestive Measures Based on Tamil Nadu Experience\n12\n\n18\nSpeciﬁ c Recommendations for Government of Tamil Nadu\n13\n• \nA high-level expert committee for Chennai city should be formed. This committee should be \ngiven adequate authority to take decisions on-site to appropriately regulate and release water \nfrom upstream lakes/tanks keeping in view hydrological and meteorological forecasts issued for \nthe region. During heavy rainfall, this committee should have a ﬁ nal say on releasing water from \nlakes/tanks/water bodies on the basis of reviewing the inﬂ ow forecasts.\n• \nChennai city should develop its own network of Automatic Weather Stations (AWS), say one \nstation for every four sq. km., for effective monitoring of rainfall and issuing of warnings. These \nshould be used in conjunction with satellite map animations, IMD warnings and ﬂ ood forecasting \nsoftware. It should address sudden thunderstorm ﬂ ooding (20 mm/hr to 120 mm/hr), rapid \nmoving weather disturbances, heavy rains due to various factors, etc.\n• \nDocumentation of best practices and sharing the same in public domain so that other States \nmay learn and mitigate risks of ﬂ ooding based on Chennai’s experience. This may also help other \ncountries, especially the developing nations of Asia, plan ﬂ ood rehabilitation efforts.\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\nAnnexure II\nList of Participants at Kancheepuram on 21.06.2017\nSl.

      "4\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nthat encompasses “the creation of safe \nenvironments for children starting from \ntheir homes to their schools and back3.”\n1.3 \nNational Policy Instruments\nConstitution of India: As per the Indian \nConstitution, access to education is a fundamental \nright of each child in the country\nNational Policy on Children (2013): The \nNational \nPolicy \nfor \nChildren \nreaffirms \nthe \nGovernment‘s commitment to the realization of \nrights of all children in the country. It recognizes \nthat “every person below the age of eighteen \nyears as a child and that childhood is an integral \npart of life with a value of own, and long term, \nsustainable, \nmulti-sectoral, \nintegrated, \nand \ninclusive approach is necessary for the harmonious \ndevelopment and protection of our children”. The \nPolicy has identified survival, health, nutrition, \neducation, development, protection (including \nfrom emergencies/disasters) and participation as \nthe undeniable rights of every child, and has also \ndeclared these as key priority areas. \nNational Disaster Management Act (2005): \nThe National Disaster Management Act 2005 \nlays down the institutional, legal, financial \nand \ncoordination \nmechanisms \nfor \nDisaster \nManagement (DM) at the national, state, \ndistrict and local levels. Through the National \nInstitute of Disaster Management, the Act \nenvisages promotion of safety awareness among \nstakeholders including teachers and students.\nNational Policy on Disaster Management \n(NPDM), 2009: The National Policy on Disaster \nManagement 2009 highlights the need for \nstructural as well as non- structural safety in \nschools and educational institutions. In the \nchapter on Techno-legal Regime, in section 6.4.1, \nthe Policy identifies school buildings as a national \npriority and enables provision for designing the \nschool buildings/hostels with earthquake resilient \nfeatures and equip them with appropriate fire \nsafety measures. In the chapter on capacity \ndevelopment under section 10.2.2, the policy \nalso emphasizes upon disaster management \ntraining in all educational institutions including \nschools. Section 10.5.1 makes a reference to the \nrole of National Cadet Corps (NCC) and scouts \nand guides in schools and colleges for disaster \nmanagement related work. Section 10.6.1 of \nNPDM discusses the introduction of subject of \ndisaster management in the curriculum through \nthe Central and State Boards of Secondary \nEducation. \nNational Policy on Education (NPE) 1968, \nRevised in 1992, the National Policy on \nEducation calls for a \"child-centred approach\" \nin primary education, but does not contain a \nspecific reference to school safety or disaster risk \nissues of children.\nRight to Education Act 2009: Right to Education \n(RTE) Act 2009 guarantees free and compulsory \neducation to all the children in the country till \nthe age of 14. The Act sets minimum norms and \nstandards with regard to location and quality \nof schools and in Clause 19, lays down that no \nschool shall be established, or recognized unless \nit fulfils the norms and standards specified in the \nschedule. One of the key standards is in relation \nto access to “all weather buildings”; in “areas \nwith difficult terrain, risk of landslides, floods, \nlack of roads and in general, danger for young \nchildren in the approach…the State Government \n/ Local Authority shall locate the school in such a \nmanner as to avoid such dangers”. The Act lays \ndown the formation of the School Management \nCommittee for planning of infrastructure and \nother requirements with respect to operational \nfunctioning of schools. The School Development \nPlan, as laid out by the Act, spells out the  \nphysical requirements of additional infrastructure \nand equipments to meet the norms spelt out in \nthe schedule (in relation to all weather buildings). \nThe RTE Rules provide detailed guidance on \nimplementation of the Act on the ground.\n1.4 \nScope of the Guidelines:\nThe National School Safety Policy Guidelines \ndraw the attention of the decision makers on \nschool education in India (both government and \nprivate) upon the urgent need to strengthen risk \nresilience of schools in rural as well as urban areas \nof the country. It is hoped that this document will \nbe useful for these institutions to ensure that all \nschool children across the country remain safe \nfrom any kind of disaster risk as they access their \nright to education.\n3.

      "7\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\n2.1 \nVision\nThe National School Safety Policy Guidelines \napply to all schools in the country – whether \ngovernment, aided or private, irrespective of their \nlocation in rural or urban areas. They apply to all \nstakeholders involved in delivery of education to \nchildren in India. The Guidelines stand for a vision \nof India where all children and their teachers, \nand other stakeholders in the school community \nare safe from any kind of preventable risks \ndue to natural hazards that may threaten their \nwell-being during the pursuit of education. The \nguidelines also actively promote that educational \ncontinuity is maintained / resumed even in \nthe immediate aftermath of a disaster so that \nchildren are physically, mentally and emotionally \nsecure within their schools. Right to Education \nis a fundamental right enshrined in the \nConstitution of India. In order to facilitate \naccess of all children in the country with respect \nto the Right to Education, it is important to \nensure that children remain safe as they access \nand enjoy their Right to Education. \n2.2 \nKey Challenges for Safe Schools\nEfforts on school safety at the National and State \nlevels are at an evolving stage. Key challenges in \nimplementation of school safety measures include: \n●\t\nDisconnect \nbetween \ninstitutions: \nThere is a visible disconnect between the \n‘non-emergency’ schemes (Pertaining to \nEducation) such as Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan \nand Disaster response / preparedness. \nEducation programmes are executed in \nmost states with little synergy or policy \nlinkages with the SDMA / DDMA.\n●\t\nLimited \nconvergence \nbetween \nschemes: Resources required for effective \nimplementation of a govt. scheme cannot \nbe leveraged in the absence of a mechanism \nfor collaborative working with other budget \nholders. For instance, land development \nwithin the school campus may be funded \nthrough Mahatma Gandhi National Rural \nEmployment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). \nHowever, close coordination between micro \nplanning activity for MGNREGA and School \nDevelopment Plan preparation would be \nnecessary for convergence.\n●\t\nLimited \nunderstanding \nof \nschool \nsafety concept: It is evident that the \nexisting \neducation \nmachinery \nin \nthe \ncountry is keen to promote safe learning \nenvironment for children and teachers but \nactual implementation of programmes on \nground points to limited understanding of \nthe concept of safety. At best, new school \ndesigns incorporate earthquake safety \nfeatures in many areas; however floods, \ncyclones, landslides have been given little \nattention in design and costing of schools. \nIn addition non-structural elements are \noften not understood as threats to safety. \nAt the level of teachers and students, safety \nissues are discussed and pursued as one off \nactivities. School timetable and curriculum \nneed suitable modifications to make safety \nunderstanding a routine activity.\nThe National School Safety Policy Guidelines \nemphasize on the need for active mainstreaming \nof disaster risk reduction in all the school education \ninitiatives in the country. This would require \na collaborative approach between the state \neducation departments and the state disaster \nmanagement machinery. Collaboration, would be \nnecessary especially for capacity development \nactivities such as sensitization of officials, public \nawareness on disasters, training of students \nand teachers; pre-positioning equipments for \nemergency response, creation of educational \nmaterial on disasters and, monitoring of risk.\nVision, Approach and  \nObjectives of the Guidelines\n2\nSection 2",
      "11\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\n3.1 \nStrengthening \nInstitutional \nCommitment to Safe Learning \nEnvironment for Children \nThe first and foremost step in promoting safety \nof learning spaces is to sensitize and strengthen \nofficial structures and mechanisms responsible \nfor safety at the State, District and Local levels. \n3.1.1 \nInstitutional Strengthening at the \nState and District Level\nThe institutional and regulatory framework as \nlaid down in the various National Acts provides \nfor realizing the Right to Education as well \nas Disaster Management in the country. For \nensuring that students and their teachers remain \nsafe in pursuit of education, it is necessary \nthat the two institutional frameworks act in \nconvergence with each other, through the \nphases of preparedness, response and recovery. \nThe Right to Education Act (RTE) guarantees free \nand compulsory education to all the children in \nthe country till the age of 14 based on minimum \nnorms and standards that are mandatory for \nany school in the country to be “established, \nor recognized”. It recognizes the need for “all \nweather buildings” and limitations posed by \ndifficulty of terrain, risk of landslides, floods, \nlack of roads and in general, danger for young \nchildren in approach etc.\nThe RTE Act thus serves as a strong base for \npromoting school safety. The framework for \nimplementation of RTE-SSA has a strong focus \non Disaster Management\nThe National Disaster Management Act, 2005 \nmandates \nthe \nState \nDisaster \nManagement \nAuthorities (SDMA) to provide guidelines for \ndifferent departments to integrate disaster \nprevention and mitigation measures in their \ndevelopment \nplans \nand \nprovide \nnecessary \ntechnical assistance thereof. The SDMA needs to \nwork closely with the State Education Department \nto support the school safety efforts at the state \nlevel.\nThere is a need to co-opt senior officials of the \nDepartment of Education at the State and the \nDistrict level as part of the State and District \nDisaster Management Authorities for promotion \nof safe schools. In addition, a School Safety \nAdvisory Committee may be formed to advise \nthe education department on the subject.\nThis will ensure that school safety can be \npractically promoted through convergent action \nby the SDMA / DDMA and the education machinery \nat the state and district level. \nAs a direct consequence of this institutional \ndovetailing / convergence, the state and district \ndisaster management plans will include a focus \non educational infrastructure and supportive \naction thereof, such as status of education \ninfrastructure from a risk resilience perspective, \ncapacity building of different stakeholders on \nsafety aspects, and large scale awareness on \ndisasters among students and the community at \nlarge. In parallel, the education machinery also \nneeds to strengthen their efforts with respect to \npromoting school safety for government, aided \nas well as private schools.\nThe District Education Officer must ensure that \n‘Recognition Certificate’ under sub-rule (4) 15 \nof Right of Children to Free and Compulsory \nEducation Rules, 2010 is issued only to those \nschools that comply with safety norms laid out \nin the Building Codes. This compliance needs to \nbe monitored on a regular basis.\nIn addition, a mechanism needs to be evolved \nby the District Education Officer and designated \nRegulatory Authorities for monitoring safety \nparameters in all schools on a regular basis. Any \nexisting monitoring formats being used by the \nAuthorities shall essentially include parameters \non school safety as well.\nAction Areas\n3\nSection 3",
      "37\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nb) \nIdentify the possible risks and analyze the likelihood and impact from earthquakes, floods, \ncyclones and landslides due to the location of the project sites as well as through secondary \nevidence.\nc) \nWhat are the land-use directives, regulations applicable? List preventive measures enshrined \nin regulations which are to be complied with and confirm compliance.\nd) \nBased on the prioritization of risks, the mitigation measures being contemplated, both \nstructural and non-structural. Confirmation that the implementation of the selected mitigation \nmeasures will not create new risks.\ne) \nConfirmation that the design and engineering of the structure has taken into consideration \nthe National Building Code 2005, the appropriate BIS Codes and the NDMA guidelines. Other \nsources such as Indian Road Congress Manual, Ministry of Road Transport, Highways and \nShipping manual, Railway Board manual, Central Public Health Engineering Organisation \n(Min. of Urban Development) manual, Central Electricity Authority manual and Central \nWater Commission manual etc. may also be consulted where applicable.\nf) \nHas the cost of disaster treatment/mitigation measures been included in the \noverall project cost?\ng) \nAlso indicate that the whole process of risk assessment has been done based on available \ninformation and secondary evidence and the mitigation measure(s) are in conformity with \nthe statutory and other regulatory requirements and are the most viable ones in the present \ncircumstances.”\nThere has been a major revision in the requirements of the Expenditure and Finance \nCommittee (EFC) of Ministry of Finance, Government of India for approval of ongoing and new \nprogrammes and schemes of all the Ministries. Since 2009, the EFC note to be submitted by all \nministries includes a well defined set of questions with regard to disaster management. \nThe SSA Framework for Implementation has been revised in light of the RTE Act and a \ndedicated chapter on School Infrastructure has been provided. The chapter clearly brings out \nthe need and importance of Disaster Resistance in Schools and also gives norms and codes to be \nreferred.\nFurther, Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan Institutions have specified the space norms and appropriate \nsizes for school classrooms etc. in Kendriya Vidyalaya schools that are administered by the \nSangathan. \nRashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) guides the expansion strategy for Secondary \nSchools & Higher Secondary Schools. To provide access to secondary school for students, RMSA \nproposes up-gradation of upper primary schools through construction of classrooms laboratories, \ncomputer rooms, headmaster room, library rooms, separate toilets for girls and boys, appointment \nof additional teachers and strengthening of existing secondary schools. This scheme identifies \nEnvironment Management as an important aspect for improving quality and improving access \nof secondary education. It makes a reference to location/site selection related issues, and \nissues related to design pertaining to the difficult sites. RMSA also makes a reference to special \npurpose designs, construction related impacts, and issues related to provision and maintenance \nof facilities.\nKasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas (KGBV) scheme was launched by the Government of \nIndia in August, 2004 for setting up residential schools at upper primary level for girls belonging \npredominantly to the SC, ST, OBC and minorities in difficult areas. Initially it ran as a separate \nscheme, but was merged with the SSA with effect from 1st April, 2007. With the RTE Act, 2009 \ncoming into force with effect from 1st April 2010, and the SSA Framework of Implementation \nbeing revised to correspond to the RTE Act, the KGBV component of SSA is being implemented \nAnnexure",

In order to facilitate \naccess of all children in the country with respect \nto the Right to Education, it is important to \nensure that children remain safe as they access \nand enjoy their Right to Education. \n2.2 \nKey Challenges for Safe Schools\nEfforts on school safety at the National and State \nlevels are at an evolving stage. Key challenges in \nimplementation of school safety measures include: \n●\t\nDisconnect \nbetween \ninstitutions: \nThere is a visible disconnect between the \n‘non-emergency’ schemes (Pertaining to \nEducation) such as Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan \nand Disaster response / preparedness. \nEducation programmes are executed in \nmost states with little synergy or policy \nlinkages with the SDMA / DDMA.\n●\t\nLimited \nconvergence \nbetween \nschemes: Resources required for effective \nimplementation of a govt. scheme cannot \nbe leveraged in the absence of a mechanism \nfor collaborative working with other budget \nholders. For instance, land development \nwithin the school campus may be funded \nthrough Mahatma Gandhi National Rural \nEmployment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). \nHowever, close coordination between micro \nplanning activity for MGNREGA and School \nDevelopment Plan preparation would be \nnecessary for convergence.\n●\t\nLimited \nunderstanding \nof \nschool \nsafety concept: It is evident that the \nexisting \neducation \nmachinery \nin \nthe \ncountry is keen to promote safe learning \nenvironment for children and teachers but \nactual implementation of programmes on \nground points to limited understanding of \nthe concept of safety. At best, new school \ndesigns incorporate earthquake safety \nfeatures in many areas; however floods, \ncyclones, landslides have been given little \nattention in design and costing of schools. \nIn addition non-structural elements are \noften not understood as threats to safety. \nAt the level of teachers and students, safety \nissues are discussed and pursued as one off \nactivities. School timetable and curriculum \nneed suitable modifications to make safety \nunderstanding a routine activity.\nThe National School Safety Policy Guidelines \nemphasize on the need for active mainstreaming \nof disaster risk reduction in all the school education \ninitiatives in the country. This would require \na collaborative approach between the state \neducation departments and the state disaster \nmanagement machinery. Collaboration, would be \nnecessary especially for capacity development \nactivities such as sensitization of officials, public \nawareness on disasters, training of students \nand teachers; pre-positioning equipments for \nemergency response, creation of educational \nmaterial on disasters and, monitoring of risk.\nVision, Approach and  \nObjectives of the Guidelines\n2\nSection 2",

List preventive measures enshrined \nin regulations which are to be complied with and confirm compliance.\nd) \nBased on the prioritization of risks, the mitigation measures being contemplated, both \nstructural and non-structural. Confirmation that the implementation of the selected mitigation \nmeasures will not create new risks.\ne) \nConfirmation that the design and engineering of the structure has taken into consideration \nthe National Building Code 2005, the appropriate BIS Codes and the NDMA guidelines. Other \nsources such as Indian Road Congress Manual, Ministry of Road Transport, Highways and \nShipping manual, Railway Board manual, Central Public Health Engineering Organisation \n(Min. of Urban Development) manual, Central Electricity Authority manual and Central \nWater Commission manual etc. may also be consulted where applicable.\nf) \nHas the cost of disaster treatment/mitigation measures been included in the \noverall project cost?\ng) \nAlso indicate that the whole process of risk assessment has been done based on available \ninformation and secondary evidence and the mitigation measure(s) are in conformity with \nthe statutory and other regulatory requirements and are the most viable ones in the present \ncircumstances.”\nThere has been a major revision in the requirements of the Expenditure and Finance \nCommittee (EFC) of Ministry of Finance, Government of India for approval of ongoing and new \nprogrammes and schemes of all the Ministries. Since 2009, the EFC note to be submitted by all \nministries includes a well defined set of questions with regard to disaster management. \nThe SSA Framework for Implementation has been revised in light of the RTE Act and a \ndedicated chapter on School Infrastructure has been provided. The chapter clearly brings out \nthe need and importance of Disaster Resistance in Schools and also gives norms and codes to be \nreferred.\nFurther, Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan Institutions have specified the space norms and appropriate \nsizes for school classrooms etc. in Kendriya Vidyalaya schools that are administered by the \nSangathan. \nRashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) guides the expansion strategy for Secondary \nSchools & Higher Secondary Schools. To provide access to secondary school for students, RMSA \nproposes up-gradation of upper primary schools through construction of classrooms laboratories, \ncomputer rooms, headmaster room, library rooms, separate toilets for girls and boys, appointment \nof additional teachers and strengthening of existing secondary schools. This scheme identifies \nEnvironment Management as an important aspect for improving quality and improving access \nof secondary education. It makes a reference to location/site selection related issues, and \nissues related to design pertaining to the difficult sites. RMSA also makes a reference to special \npurpose designs, construction related impacts, and issues related to provision and maintenance \nof facilities.\nKasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas (KGBV) scheme was launched by the Government of \nIndia in August, 2004 for setting up residential schools at upper primary level for girls belonging \npredominantly to the SC, ST, OBC and minorities in difficult areas. Initially it ran as a separate \nscheme, but was merged with the SSA with effect from 1st April, 2007. With the RTE Act, 2009 \ncoming into force with effect from 1st April 2010, and the SSA Framework of Implementation \nbeing revised to correspond to the RTE Act, the KGBV component of SSA is being implemented \nAnnexure",

Higher Level of preparedness for disaster helps to \nminimise the loss of life and prevention of injures caused particularly during earthquakes for which \nthere is no warning. However certain other hazards like flood, cyclone etc. do have early warning \nsystem thereby giving some time for taking response. Children being the future of tomorrow should be \nensured a safe learning environment and prepared well to respond effectively during disasters. To put \nthis into practice it is recommended that every school constitutes a School Level Disaster Management \nCommittee along with sub committees to ensure better preparedness and response in disasters. The \nvarious committees constituted in a school will comprise of members from among teachers, non \nteaching staff as well students.

In India, there \nare great spatial and temporal variations in climatic characteristics that are reflected in the \nform of localized weather variations across the country. Whereas, the favorable weather can \nsupport boat operators in carrying out safe navigations and organizing pleasure trips, the poor \nweather can spoil the trip and may cause emergency situations that may eventually lead to \nmajor disasters like boat capsizing, collision etc. It is, therefore essential for boat owners and \nwaterways management authorities to pay much attention on weather bulletins and guidelines \nissued by local meteorological organizations to avert boat tragedies.     \n2.1.1 \nForecast of hydro-meteorological events related to passenger boating suffers from \ntechnology and typically short lead-time limitations. However, even with such \nlimitations forecast could be made with a fair degree of accuracy with select technology \nchoices. \n2.2 \nWeather Forecasting for Safe Boat Operations\n2.2.1 \nIndia Meteorological Department (IMD) \n \nIndia Meteorological Department (IMD) is the nodal agency in the Government of \nIndia providing vital information about the meteorological observations, weather \nforecasting and early warning at the national level. The information issued by IMD is \ngainfully utilized in the optimum operation of weather-sensitive activities. IMD issues \nadvance warning information at stipulated intervals to government functionaries, \nmedia and general public against severe weather phenomena like tropical cyclones, \nthunderstorm, dust storms, heavy rains, snow, cold/heat waves etc. The primary \naim of providing warnings ahead of a hazard impact is to empower individuals and \ncommunities to respond appropriately to the hazard threat in order to reduce the \nrisk of death, injury, property loss and damage. It is, therefore, essential for all the \nWeather Forecasting & Early  \nWarning System\n2",

      "14\n10.1  Each disaster presents an opportunity to learn from it. The Tamil Nadu Government used the \nopportunity presented to it after the December 2015 deluge to strengthen disaster preparedness \nin the State. A year later, in December 2016, the city was face-to-face with another extreme \nweather event, the tropical Cyclone Vardah. This time around, the government had put in place \npreparedness measures to deal with any freak rainfall, ﬂ ood, cloudburst, drought or cyclonic storm \nincident well in advance. Accordingly, Tamil Nadu SDMA vide Letter No. NC1 (4)/5779/2016, \ndated 04.10.2016 issued an Order to all District Collectors and Greater Chennai Corporation \nwith consolidated instructions to be followed for North East Monsoons 2016 complete with a \ncheck list and formats for reporting the implementation and progress of various measures weekly \n(Annexure XIV). This greatly minimized loss of lives as rescue and evacuation operations could \nbe effectively organized. Massive restoration efforts were launched and the infrastructure was \nbrought back to normalcy within a very short time.\n10.2  Key highlights of the preparedness measures taken to mitigate the impact of Vardah Cyclone and \nNorth East Monsoons during 2016 are as follows:\n• \nSpecial drive to clean channels leading to water tanks is undertaken before the monsoon \nseason.\n• \nGaps between Government and Private Sector efforts were bridged. Private companies came \nforward, post-disaster, for repairing vehicles, re-phasing loans and personnel management.\n• \nThe State Government had convened a meeting with all Stakeholders to discuss their \ncontingency plans which ensured pre-emptive deployment of response forces. Additional \nTeams of NDRF, SDRF and Columns from Army, Navy and Coast Guard were mobilized and \npre-positioned in vulnerable areas.\n• \nSimilar meetings were held at the district and state level to sensitize hospitals, educational \nand industrial organizations, communication service providers and Oil Companies etc. \nsensitizing them to be equipped with institutional strategies for immediate response during \ndisasters. They were also sensitized to make back-up arrangements to ensure continuity of \nlife saving services, especially in the hospitals. \n• \nA coordinated approach covered timely evacuation and minimum casualties. \n• \nPower supplies were turned off during ﬂ oods/cyclonic storms.\n• \nDiesel Generators (DG) were shifted to elevated level/upper ﬂ oors. DG sets of mobile service \noperators were damaged during 2015 ﬂ oods as they were installed in the basements.\n• \nSufﬁ cient diesel/oil stock with power/oil/telecom companies with proper storage facilities \nat safe locations. While only BSNL had enough stock during 2015, each of these service \nproviders had enough stock during the 2016 North East Monsoon.\nApplication of Key Lessons Learnt \n10",
      "16\n11.1  Besides immediate relief measures, Govt. of Tamil Nadu had also undertaken a slew of long-term \nmeasures to prevent the recurrence of a similar disaster situation in the future. These initiatives \naddress the fundamental causes underlying such catastrophes and can easily be contextualized \nfor major cities across the country.\n• \nMaster Plan 2030, drawing lessons from the 2015 deluge, is under preparation. This will \nresult in an institutional framework to manage disasters of such magnitude by way of a long-\nterm plan.\n• \nLong-term conservation and response plans are being drawn.\n• \nRegulation of tanks/reservoirs is being prepared.\n• \nClassiﬁ cation and subsequent mapping of both rural/urban areas to decide their vulnerability \nto ﬂ ooding depending on inundation: 5ft. and above water - high vulnerability; 2-3 ft. water - \nmoderate vulnerability, less than 2 ft. water - low vulnerability. \n• \nPlans to deploy unmanned vehicles (drones) for aerial photography.\n• \nProposal to equip SDRF with cranes of 100 tonnes capacity to remove blockages due to water \nhyacinths.\n• \nUAV photogrammetry of all rivers in rural areas.\n• \nSea-side Storm Surge Modelling.\n• \nStudy the designed discharge capacity of tanks as it may have cascading effects on breaching \nof tanks.\n• \nA compendium of water resources to be made public.\n• \nConstitute Inter-Departmental Teams with Team Leaders for pre-inspection and monitoring \ndesignated areas.\n• \nIdentify escape routes to the nearest relief shelter on vulnerability maps. \n• \nHospitals were asked to prepare their emergency plans.\nOther Measures Taken for Better Preparedness\n11",
      "18\nSpeciﬁ c Recommendations for Government of Tamil Nadu\n13\n• \nA high-level expert committee for Chennai city should be formed. This committee should be \ngiven adequate authority to take decisions on-site to appropriately regulate and release water \nfrom upstream lakes/tanks keeping in view hydrological and meteorological forecasts issued for \nthe region. During heavy rainfall, this committee should have a ﬁ nal say on releasing water from \nlakes/tanks/water bodies on the basis of reviewing the inﬂ ow forecasts.\n• \nChennai city should develop its own network of Automatic Weather Stations (AWS), say one \nstation for every four sq. km., for effective monitoring of rainfall and issuing of warnings. These \nshould be used in conjunction with satellite map animations, IMD warnings and ﬂ ood forecasting \nsoftware. It should address sudden thunderstorm ﬂ ooding (20 mm/hr to 120 mm/hr), rapid \nmoving weather disturbances, heavy rains due to various factors, etc.\n• \nDocumentation of best practices and sharing the same in public domain so that other States \nmay learn and mitigate risks of ﬂ ooding based on Chennai’s experience.

      "In developing countries like India, schools \nare often located in vulnerable areas and \nunprepared to respond to emergencies. In recent \nyears, schools in India have witnessed many \ncatastrophic incidents: a fire led to the deaths of \nover 400 people —about half of them students—\nat a school’s prize giving ceremony in Dabwali \nHaryana in 1995; In 2001 a total of 31 teachers \ndied and 95 were injured; 971 students perished \nand 1,051 were injured in the Bhuj Earthquake, \nGujarat. Formal education was disrupted due to \nwidespread damage to physical infrastructure. \nMany of the buildings collapsed and many \nother were declared unfit for use. Many of these \nbuildings had been poorly constructed, lacked \nearthquake resistant features and were badly \nmaintained. A fire at the Lord Krishna School \nin Kumbakonam, Tamilnadu took the lives of \n94 children in 2004; thousands of students \nand teachers were killed, injured or otherwise \naffected in the 2004 South Asia Tsunami; and 15 \nchildren and 3 teachers died in a boat accident \nduring a school picnic at Kerala in 2007. \nEducation, public awareness and proper training \nfor enhancing the capacity is the cornerstone \nof approaches aimed at reducing vulnerabilities \nto natural hazards. The Hyogo Framework for \nAction 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of \nNations and Communities to Disasters, adopted \nat the World Conference on Disaster Reduction, \nhighlights knowledge and education as one of the \nfive main priorities of action. Attention should be \naccorded and support given to efforts targeting \nschool children and youth with the aim of making \npeople more aware of the threat of hazards and \nof the need and possibility to become better \nprepared before disasters strike.\nTowards this end, Government of India has \napproved a National School Safety Programme \n- a Demonstration Project to be implemented \nby National Disaster Management Authority  \n     To promote a culture of disaster \npreparedness in the school\n• To initiate policy level changes for ensuring\nsafe school environment.\n• To sensitize children and the school \ncommunity on disaster preparedness and \nsafety measures.\n• To motivate direct participation of key \nstakeholders in activities that would \nhelp building towards a disaster resilient \ncommunity.\n• To promote capacity building of officials, \nteachers and students.\n• To carry out Information, Education and \nCommunication (IEC) activities in schools and \nassociated environment.\n• To implement non-structural mitigation \nmeasures in select schools.\n• To carry out demonstrative structural \nretrofitting in select  schools.\nBackground\nVision\nObjective\n(NDMA) in partnership with Ministry of Human \nResource \nDevelopment \n(MHRD) \n, \nState/\nUT Governments, National and International \nAgencies in 43 districts of 22 States /UTs of the \ncountry falling in seismic zone IV & V .",
      "35\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nAnnexure – 1\nSnapshot on the number of deaths and damage to school infrastructure in \nDisaster – Global and National\nThere have been several instances of children losing their lives or suffering serious injuries due to \nvarious natural disasters. In 2008 Haiti earthquake, half of the schools in the country was destroyed \n(Reliefweb 2008). The Sichuan Earthquake in 2008 caused collapse of over 7,000 school buildings \n(Reliefweb, 2008).  The 2005 Kashmir earthquake resulted in collapse of over 8000 schools on both \nsides of the border; altogether over 18000 children lost their lives while at school (BBC 2005).\nA fire led to the death of about 200 children at the prize giving ceremony at a school in Dabwali, \nHaryana in 1995; a total of 31 teachers died and 95 were injured.  During the 2001 Gujarat Earthquake \nover 11,600 schools were destroyed/ damaged; 971 students perished and 1,051 were injured. \n(World Bank 2001). Similarly the fire at Lord Krishna School in Kumbakonam, Tamilnadu caused \ndeath of 94 children and thousands of students and teachers were impacted in South India in the \naftermath of the 2004 Tsunami.\nCause for such state of affairs has largely been poor quality of construction, lack of disaster \nresilient features and poor maintenance of schools. The fact remains that schools are indeed \nspaces where children and teachers spend a large part of their day. Therefore the quality of these \nspaces has a bearing on their vulnerability to disaster risk.\nAnnexures\nAnnexure",
      "National Disaster Management Authority\n1\n1.1 \nOverview\n1.1.1 \nThe tradition of boat navigation in India has a long cultural history which dates back \nabout 6000 years ago, when the art of navigation was originated from river Sindh \n(Indus). The word “Navigation” is derived from a Sanskrit word “Nav Gatih”. Ancient \nliteratures and scriptures provide several accounts of navigation in river channels and \nsmall waterways. The ‘Rig-Vedic’ period Aryans were well aware about the river and \nsea navigation routes across the country. They were skilled to construct and operate \nboats in a scientific manner.\n1.1.2. \nThe Indian subcontinent is characterized by typical hydro-meteorological set up with \ndense network of rivers system. The country is surrounded on three sides by seas \nwhich are connected with interior drainage network of rivers, thus making enabling \nenvironment for inland waterways for transportation esp. in coastal regions. Many of \nthe coastal states are endowed with natural harbors stretches along 5700 kms long \ncoastlines that act as big commercial transit point in the country.       \n1.1.3. \n In many of the states, where inland water transport through rivers and their tributaries \nis a lifeline for many people, over aged boats ply overcrowded not only with people, \nbut also vehicles, animals and other goods of daily needs. In the aftermath of Dhubri \nferry tragedy in 30th April, 2012 on river Brahmaputra that accounted for a loss of \nover 250 lives, it was recognized that passenger boats accidents are on the increase \nin various states leading to the loss of lives of scores of people .It was also discovered \nthat most of the boat tragedies were on account of overloading and other related \nfactors. There are thousands such boats plying in the country’s inland waterways with \nno authentic checks on the validity/permits. Whenever any boat accident occurs, \nthe reason often points to poor training, dangerous working practices, inadequate \nregulation and near non-existent enforcement as the root causes for this and similar \nlosses of life. Sometimes boat accidents also take place during adventure sports \nBoat Navigation-Status  \n& Context\n1",
      "Boat NavigatioN-StatuS & CoNtext\n3\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n \nThe rapid expansion of railway network and increase in canal irrigation resulted in \nthe decline of cheap river and canal transportation in the waterways of the region. \nThough the Upper and the Lower Ganga canals were built to serve the dual purpose of \nirrigation and navigation, neither of them carries any traffic now. The same condition \nof extinction also occurred in the Sutlej waterways.\n \nEast India is a land of mighty rivers which often damage railway lines and roads during \nthe rainy season. Volumes of consumer goods, fertilizers for tea plantations, and \nmachinery leave Calcutta for Assam by steamers which pass through Bangladesh. \nTwo such inland waterways are between Kolkata and Dhubri as well Kolkata and \nKarimganj. The river Hooghly in West Bengal is an important waterway in east India. \nCargo services also operate regularly between Haldia and Patna. \n \nThe rivers on the Indian Plateau are not suitable for navigation because there is very \nlittle water in the streams during the long dry months. Some distributaries of the \ndeltas of the Krishna, the Godavari and the Mahanadi are navigable. In the middle \nof the last century, irrigation cum-navigation canals were constructed in the deltas \nof the Godavari and Krishna. The canals are particularly suitable means of transport \nhere in view of the difficulty in constructing rail and road bridges on numerous \ndistributaries in the delta regions. These canals now carry a sizable portion of goods \nand passenger traffic. They are inter-connected and, also join the Buckingham Canal \nwhich runs southwards to Chennai and extends for 106 km even beyond Chennai. \nThus, Vijayawada is connected with Chennai by this navigable canal, but fast running \ntrain again has affected adversely the goods and passenger traffic carried by this canal. \nThe Buckingham Canal connects some lagoons and is meant purely for navigation. \nThe coastal lowland of Kerala State is served with navigable canals which also connect \nmany lagoons. The canals are used extensively by country boats for transporting \ngoods like coconut, cashew-nut, pepper and raw rubber. Inland water transport is \nalso important in Goa.\n1.2.2 \nInland Waterways- Economic & Social Context\n \nThe Inland Water Transport (IWT) in India is considered as one of the cost effective, \nrelatively fuel efficient, and environment friendly means of transportation. This also \nprovides livelihoods to many people living along the river courses. India is among \nthose counties where new initiatives are being undertaken to make better use of the \nexisting capacity of Inland waterways transportation. Several development projects \naimed towards the enhancement of inland water transportation infrastructures are",

Out of the total navigable length of about 14500 km, approx 5200 kms. of \nrivers and 4000 kms. of canals are being used by mechanized vessels for navigation. The \nNorth East regions alone subscribe to about 1800 kms of river routes. A large portion \nof it is presently used for transportation of passengers and cargos by mechanized and \nnon-mechanized boats including country boats. It is, therefore needed that social \ncontrol coupled with technology and management support aided by financial and \nregulatory incentives and disincentives may be  promoted that can lead to sizeable \nand competitive expansion of inland water transport and passenger boat industry in \nthe growth Matrix.  \n1.2.3 \nInland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI)\n \nThe  Government of India (GoI) established Inland Waterways Authority of India \n(IWAI) as a statutory body in 1986 entrusted it with the responsibility  to develop, \nmaintain and regulate the  national waterways, and to advise the central and the state \ngovernments on matters relating to the development of inland water transport. IWAI \nis a legal authority in-charge of the waterways in India and was created by the Govt. \nof India on 27 October 1986. Its headquarters is located in Noida, Uttar Pradesh and \nregional offices are at Patna, Kolkata, Guwahati and Kochi and sub-offices at Allahabad, \nVaranasi, Bhagalpur, Farrakka and Kollam. The function of IWAI is to build necessary \ninfrastructure in the waterways, survey the economic possibilities of new projects, \nadministrate, develop and regulate the waterways for navigation and shipping.\n \nMore recently the government has taken a series of decisions  to revitalise the \ninland water transport system to improve its reliability and efficiency and to enable \nit to complement other modes such as road and rail. The government’s new policy \nis to create ‘highways’ on the waterways and to maintain them with private sector \nparticipation and assistance from international aid agencies like the World Bank. \n \nThere has been a policy decision to grant a tax holiday of ten years to this sector, and \nto  encourage private Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs)  to bring in modern technology \nto upgrade the indigenous capabilities. Another important policy initiative taken is \nto involve more actively, the concerned state governments in the development of \ninland water transport. Techno-Economic studies have been conducted on many new \nwaterways such as the Godavari, Krishna, Buckingham Canal System from Kakinada to \nMarcanum, the Sunderbans, Goa rivers, Brahmani & East Coast Canal from Talcher to \nParadip & Haldia, the DVC Canal, Barak river etc. which have potential for immediate \ndevelopment.",
      "Boat NavigatioN-StatuS & CoNtext\n5\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n \nIt is estimated that the north-eastern region has about 1800 km of river routes \nthat can be used by steamers and large country boats. The inland water transport \ndepartments of both the state and central governments have been trying to improve \nthe water transport system in the region. The river Brahmaputra now has several \nsmall river-ports like Sadiya, Dibrugarh, Neamati, Tezpur, Guwahati, Jogighopa and \nDhubri. Besides, there are more than thirty pairs of ferry-ghats on the Brahmaputra, \ntransporting men and materials. The River Barak also has small ports at Karimganj, \nBadarpur and Silchar and ferry services at several places across it. The major tributaries \nof Brahmaputra namely Lohit, Dhansiri and Subansiri, rivers of Tripura namely Gumti \nand Haora, Tizu river in Nagaland, Kolodyne river in Mizoram are having immense \nnavigation potential and it can be developed for better utilization of both cargo and \npassenger movements.\n1.2.4 \nNational Waterways in India\n \nThere are total five national waterways in India; which provide means of public and \nfreight transportation. Cargo transportation is only limited to a few waterways in Goa, \nWest Bengal, Assam and Kerala in an organized manner\n \nThe concept of National Waterways was introduced in 1982 to promote the \ndevelopment of inland water transport in the country. Following 5 (five) waterways \nwere declared National waterways by separate acts of parliament.\n \n1. \nNational Waterway 1 - This important waterway covers the length of 1620 kms. \ntretching from Allahabad to Haldia in the Ganges–Bhagirathi–Hooghly river \nsystem. This was established in October, 1986. It has fixed terminals at Haldia, \nBISN (Kolkata), Pakur, Farrakka & Patna and floating terminals at Haldia, Kolkata, \nDiamond Harbour, Katwa , Tribeni , Baharampur, Jangipur, Bhagalpur, Semaria, \nDoriganj, Ballia, Ghazipur, Varanasi, Chunar and Allahabad.\n \n2. \nNational Waterway 2 running from Sadiya to Dhubri stretch of river Brahmaputra \nhaving the total length of 891 kms. This was established in September, 1988. \nThe Pandu is having fixed terminal facility whereas Dhubri, Jogighopa, Tezpur, \nSilghat, Dibrugarh, Jamgurhi, Bogibil, Saikhowa  and Sadiya are floating terminals.\n \n3. \nNational Waterway 3 lies on the Kottapuram-Kollam stretch of the West Coast \nCanal, Champakara Canal and Udyogmandal Canal. It was established in February \n1993. The total length of the route is 205 km. Thrikkunnapuzha, Kollam and \nAlappuzha are fixed terminals on this waterway.",

It is observed that the safety of the boatman, operating conditions \nof boats and boat making docks, inconsistent or nonexistent ferry ghat infrastructures \nhave not been outlined much in the rules and ferry acts available. \n \nThere is an overall paucity of control measures over the private boat operating \nservices in major water channels. Such boats do have little safety measures, yet daily \npassengers have no other means than to travel in such dangerous conditions.\n \nThe following prime factors contribute to boat/ferry accidents in most of the inland \nwaterways -\n \n• \nUnderstaffing/Unqualified crew\n \n• \nSevere overcrowding\n \n• \nAgeing vessels \n \n• \nLack of regulatory standards\n \n• \nFaulty boat design and stability",

This ﬂ ood put a large number of urban populace \nof these areas in great difﬁ culty and caused severe damages to public and private property. Water \nentered buildings, even in ﬁ rst ﬂ oors in some areas, stranding residents on building rooftops \nwithout essential provisions - food, water and electricity, besides completely damaging all their \nhousehold durable assets and motor vehicles, and rendering their homes uninhabitable for long \nperiod to come. People were shifted to temporary shelters set up by the State Government.",
      "14\n10.1  Each disaster presents an opportunity to learn from it. The Tamil Nadu Government used the \nopportunity presented to it after the December 2015 deluge to strengthen disaster preparedness \nin the State. A year later, in December 2016, the city was face-to-face with another extreme \nweather event, the tropical Cyclone Vardah. This time around, the government had put in place \npreparedness measures to deal with any freak rainfall, ﬂ ood, cloudburst, drought or cyclonic storm \nincident well in advance. Accordingly, Tamil Nadu SDMA vide Letter No. NC1 (4)/5779/2016, \ndated 04.10.2016 issued an Order to all District Collectors and Greater Chennai Corporation \nwith consolidated instructions to be followed for North East Monsoons 2016 complete with a \ncheck list and formats for reporting the implementation and progress of various measures weekly \n(Annexure XIV). This greatly minimized loss of lives as rescue and evacuation operations could \nbe effectively organized. Massive restoration efforts were launched and the infrastructure was \nbrought back to normalcy within a very short time.\n10.2  Key highlights of the preparedness measures taken to mitigate the impact of Vardah Cyclone and \nNorth East Monsoons during 2016 are as follows:\n• \nSpecial drive to clean channels leading to water tanks is undertaken before the monsoon \nseason.\n• \nGaps between Government and Private Sector efforts were bridged. Private companies came \nforward, post-disaster, for repairing vehicles, re-phasing loans and personnel management.\n• \nThe State Government had convened a meeting with all Stakeholders to discuss their \ncontingency plans which ensured pre-emptive deployment of response forces. Additional \nTeams of NDRF, SDRF and Columns from Army, Navy and Coast Guard were mobilized and \npre-positioned in vulnerable areas.\n• \nSimilar meetings were held at the district and state level to sensitize hospitals, educational \nand industrial organizations, communication service providers and Oil Companies etc. \nsensitizing them to be equipped with institutional strategies for immediate response during \ndisasters. They were also sensitized to make back-up arrangements to ensure continuity of \nlife saving services, especially in the hospitals. \n• \nA coordinated approach covered timely evacuation and minimum casualties. \n• \nPower supplies were turned off during ﬂ oods/cyclonic storms.\n• \nDiesel Generators (DG) were shifted to elevated level/upper ﬂ oors. DG sets of mobile service \noperators were damaged during 2015 ﬂ oods as they were installed in the basements.\n• \nSufﬁ cient diesel/oil stock with power/oil/telecom companies with proper storage facilities \nat safe locations. While only BSNL had enough stock during 2015, each of these service \nproviders had enough stock during the 2016 North East Monsoon.\nApplication of Key Lessons Learnt \n10",
      "16\n11.1  Besides immediate relief measures, Govt. of Tamil Nadu had also undertaken a slew of long-term \nmeasures to prevent the recurrence of a similar disaster situation in the future. These initiatives \naddress the fundamental causes underlying such catastrophes and can easily be contextualized \nfor major cities across the country.\n• \nMaster Plan 2030, drawing lessons from the 2015 deluge, is under preparation. This will \nresult in an institutional framework to manage disasters of such magnitude by way of a long-\nterm plan.\n• \nLong-term conservation and response plans are being drawn.\n• \nRegulation of tanks/reservoirs is being prepared.\n• \nClassiﬁ cation and subsequent mapping of both rural/urban areas to decide their vulnerability \nto ﬂ ooding depending on inundation: 5ft. and above water - high vulnerability; 2-3 ft. water - \nmoderate vulnerability, less than 2 ft. water - low vulnerability. \n• \nPlans to deploy unmanned vehicles (drones) for aerial photography.\n• \nProposal to equip SDRF with cranes of 100 tonnes capacity to remove blockages due to water \nhyacinths.\n• \nUAV photogrammetry of all rivers in rural areas.\n• \nSea-side Storm Surge Modelling.\n• \nStudy the designed discharge capacity of tanks as it may have cascading effects on breaching \nof tanks.\n• \nA compendium of water resources to be made public.\n• \nConstitute Inter-Departmental Teams with Team Leaders for pre-inspection and monitoring \ndesignated areas.\n• \nIdentify escape routes to the nearest relief shelter on vulnerability maps. \n• \nHospitals were asked to prepare their emergency plans.\nOther Measures Taken for Better Preparedness\n11",

      "ix\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nThe National School Safety Policy Guidelines stand for a vision of India where all children and their \nteachers, and other stakeholders in the school community are safe from any kind of risks due to \nnatural hazards. The Guidelines focus upon the urgent need to strengthen risk resilience of schools \nin rural as well as urban areas of the country. It is hoped that this document will be useful to ensure \nthat all school children across the country remain safe from any kind of disaster risk as they access \ntheir right to education.\n \nThe Guidelines highlight upon the following key elements:\n● \nAddresses the vertical of school safety in a more inclusive and holistic manner in the \nnational policy sphere\n● \nCapacity building of children, teachers, school personnel, state and district education \nmachinery on school safety and disaster preparedness\n● \nAnchoring /implementing child centered community based disaster risk reduction in \nthe local context \n● \nMainstreaming risk and safety education in the school curriculum.\n● \nLinking school safety in the existing government schemes and policies.\n● \nStrengthening coordination amongst institutional structures at the district, state, and \nnational levels to promote effective child rights governance in disaster situations\n \nChapter 1 introduces the concept and examines the importance on school safety as placed \nin the various national policies and guidelines.\n \nChapter 2 details the key challenges faced while addressing safety issues in schools, the \ncore principles of school safety which have been kept in mind while formulating the said guidelines \nand the vision and objectives of the guidelines.\n \nChapter 3 details the various activities that need to be undertaken at the state, district \nand local levels to be able to address school safety in a holistic manner. This includes, school safety \nplanning at designated levels, preparation of school disaster management plans, implementation \nof safety actions (structural and non –structural measures, capacity building of stakeholders, \nincorporation of school safety and disaster preparedness in core curriculum, monitoring of risk and \nmainstreaming of disaster risk reduction in all the school education initiatives.\n \nChapter 4 details the roles and responsibilities of the various stakeholders to ensure \nschool safety at national, state and local levels.\n \nChapter 5 highlights specific actions towards school safety that can be undertaken by \ndifferent stakeholders within the existing framework for delivery of education.\nExecutive Summary",
      "4\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nthat encompasses “the creation of safe \nenvironments for children starting from \ntheir homes to their schools and back3.”\n1.3 \nNational Policy Instruments\nConstitution of India: As per the Indian \nConstitution, access to education is a fundamental \nright of each child in the country\nNational Policy on Children (2013): The \nNational \nPolicy \nfor \nChildren \nreaffirms \nthe \nGovernment‘s commitment to the realization of \nrights of all children in the country. It recognizes \nthat “every person below the age of eighteen \nyears as a child and that childhood is an integral \npart of life with a value of own, and long term, \nsustainable, \nmulti-sectoral, \nintegrated, \nand \ninclusive approach is necessary for the harmonious \ndevelopment and protection of our children”. The \nPolicy has identified survival, health, nutrition, \neducation, development, protection (including \nfrom emergencies/disasters) and participation as \nthe undeniable rights of every child, and has also \ndeclared these as key priority areas. \nNational Disaster Management Act (2005): \nThe National Disaster Management Act 2005 \nlays down the institutional, legal, financial \nand \ncoordination \nmechanisms \nfor \nDisaster \nManagement (DM) at the national, state, \ndistrict and local levels. Through the National \nInstitute of Disaster Management, the Act \nenvisages promotion of safety awareness among \nstakeholders including teachers and students.\nNational Policy on Disaster Management \n(NPDM), 2009: The National Policy on Disaster \nManagement 2009 highlights the need for \nstructural as well as non- structural safety in \nschools and educational institutions. In the \nchapter on Techno-legal Regime, in section 6.4.1, \nthe Policy identifies school buildings as a national \npriority and enables provision for designing the \nschool buildings/hostels with earthquake resilient \nfeatures and equip them with appropriate fire \nsafety measures. In the chapter on capacity \ndevelopment under section 10.2.2, the policy \nalso emphasizes upon disaster management \ntraining in all educational institutions including \nschools. Section 10.5.1 makes a reference to the \nrole of National Cadet Corps (NCC) and scouts \nand guides in schools and colleges for disaster \nmanagement related work. Section 10.6.1 of \nNPDM discusses the introduction of subject of \ndisaster management in the curriculum through \nthe Central and State Boards of Secondary \nEducation. \nNational Policy on Education (NPE) 1968, \nRevised in 1992, the National Policy on \nEducation calls for a \"child-centred approach\" \nin primary education, but does not contain a \nspecific reference to school safety or disaster risk \nissues of children.\nRight to Education Act 2009: Right to Education \n(RTE) Act 2009 guarantees free and compulsory \neducation to all the children in the country till \nthe age of 14. The Act sets minimum norms and \nstandards with regard to location and quality \nof schools and in Clause 19, lays down that no \nschool shall be established, or recognized unless \nit fulfils the norms and standards specified in the \nschedule. One of the key standards is in relation \nto access to “all weather buildings”; in “areas \nwith difficult terrain, risk of landslides, floods, \nlack of roads and in general, danger for young \nchildren in the approach…the State Government \n/ Local Authority shall locate the school in such a \nmanner as to avoid such dangers”. The Act lays \ndown the formation of the School Management \nCommittee for planning of infrastructure and \nother requirements with respect to operational \nfunctioning of schools. The School Development \nPlan, as laid out by the Act, spells out the  \nphysical requirements of additional infrastructure \nand equipments to meet the norms spelt out in \nthe schedule (in relation to all weather buildings). \nThe RTE Rules provide detailed guidance on \nimplementation of the Act on the ground.\n1.4 \nScope of the Guidelines:\nThe National School Safety Policy Guidelines \ndraw the attention of the decision makers on \nschool education in India (both government and \nprivate) upon the urgent need to strengthen risk \nresilience of schools in rural as well as urban areas \nof the country. It is hoped that this document will \nbe useful for these institutions to ensure that all \nschool children across the country remain safe \nfrom any kind of disaster risk as they access their \nright to education.\n3. Ahmedabad Action Agenda for School Safety, Outcome \ndocument of the International Conference on School \nSafety, 18th - 20th January, 2007, Ahmedabad, India\nSection 1",
      "7\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\n2.1 \nVision\nThe National School Safety Policy Guidelines \napply to all schools in the country – whether \ngovernment, aided or private, irrespective of their \nlocation in rural or urban areas. They apply to all \nstakeholders involved in delivery of education to \nchildren in India. The Guidelines stand for a vision \nof India where all children and their teachers, \nand other stakeholders in the school community \nare safe from any kind of preventable risks \ndue to natural hazards that may threaten their \nwell-being during the pursuit of education. The \nguidelines also actively promote that educational \ncontinuity is maintained / resumed even in \nthe immediate aftermath of a disaster so that \nchildren are physically, mentally and emotionally \nsecure within their schools. Right to Education \nis a fundamental right enshrined in the \nConstitution of India. In order to facilitate \naccess of all children in the country with respect \nto the Right to Education, it is important to \nensure that children remain safe as they access \nand enjoy their Right to Education. \n2.2 \nKey Challenges for Safe Schools\nEfforts on school safety at the National and State \nlevels are at an evolving stage. Key challenges in \nimplementation of school safety measures include: \n●\t\nDisconnect \nbetween \ninstitutions: \nThere is a visible disconnect between the \n‘non-emergency’ schemes (Pertaining to \nEducation) such as Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan \nand Disaster response / preparedness. \nEducation programmes are executed in \nmost states with little synergy or policy \nlinkages with the SDMA / DDMA.\n●\t\nLimited \nconvergence \nbetween \nschemes: Resources required for effective \nimplementation of a govt. scheme cannot \nbe leveraged in the absence of a mechanism \nfor collaborative working with other budget \nholders. For instance, land development \nwithin the school campus may be funded \nthrough Mahatma Gandhi National Rural \nEmployment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). \nHowever, close coordination between micro \nplanning activity for MGNREGA and School \nDevelopment Plan preparation would be \nnecessary for convergence.\n●\t\nLimited \nunderstanding \nof \nschool \nsafety concept: It is evident that the \nexisting \neducation \nmachinery \nin \nthe \ncountry is keen to promote safe learning \nenvironment for children and teachers but \nactual implementation of programmes on \nground points to limited understanding of \nthe concept of safety. At best, new school \ndesigns incorporate earthquake safety \nfeatures in many areas; however floods, \ncyclones, landslides have been given little \nattention in design and costing of schools. \nIn addition non-structural elements are \noften not understood as threats to safety. \nAt the level of teachers and students, safety \nissues are discussed and pursued as one off \nactivities. School timetable and curriculum \nneed suitable modifications to make safety \nunderstanding a routine activity.\nThe National School Safety Policy Guidelines \nemphasize on the need for active mainstreaming \nof disaster risk reduction in all the school education \ninitiatives in the country. This would require \na collaborative approach between the state \neducation departments and the state disaster \nmanagement machinery. Collaboration, would be \nnecessary especially for capacity development \nactivities such as sensitization of officials, public \nawareness on disasters, training of students \nand teachers; pre-positioning equipments for \nemergency response, creation of educational \nmaterial on disasters and, monitoring of risk.\nVision, Approach and  \nObjectives of the Guidelines\n2\nSection 2",
      "12\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nIn addition, each district should designate the \nBlock Education Officer or any other official as \nappropriate, for over-seeing and facilitating \nschool safety at the block level.\n3.1.2 \nInstitutional Strengthening at the \nLocal Level for Preparedness and \nResponse \nAt the local level, both in rural as well as urban \nareas, the school community broadly includes \nchildren, \nschool \nteachers, \nthe \nPrincipal \n/ \nHeadmaster and parents. These are the primary \nstakeholders of the school affairs and may be \nrepresented formally or informally in decision \nmaking bodies for the school. It is imperative \nthat these existing institutions at the school level \nare strengthened, and their potential adequately \ntapped for ensuring wellbeing of children and \nteachers from a disaster safety perspective. \nUnder the SSA, the School Management \nCommittee has been designated as the body \nresponsible for managing the affairs of the school in a \ntransparent and “bottom – up” participatory manner.\nThe School Management Committee needs to \nbe made responsible for taking on the safety \nagenda at the community and school level. The \nSchool Management Committee needs to be \nsensitized and oriented on their expected role.\nAt the school level, a School Safety Focal \nPoint Teacher (FPT) needs to be nominated \nto operationally anchor safety related actions \nat the school level as part of his / her routine \ncommitments in the School. The School Safety \nFocal Point Teachers also need to be provided \nthe necessary training to anchor the process and \nfoster action by different stakeholders responsible \nfor various activities. \nThe School Management Committee in each \nschool should be adequately trained for different \naspects of school safety in case of an imminent \ndisaster/emergency, e.g. sanitation and hygiene \nneeds of boys, girls and teachers; first aid; \nstampede \nmanagement; \nfire \nmanagement \nand control, handling of chemicals /hazardous \nmaterials in labs etc.\nEach school should also identify and develop a \ncadre of peer educators / trainers for ensuring \nthat safety messages, dos and don’ts of different \ndisasters, procedures and protocols, reach each \nand every student in the school. These peer \neducators can be trained through National Cadet \nCorps, National scouts and guides camps, by \nthe Red Cross or any other agency as deemed \nfit by the district.\nMany private schools have in place mechanisms \nto address everyday issues in relation to school \nexpansion and development, fire drills, power \noutage procedures, early dismissals on account \nof unexpected weather events, health and safety \nconcerns, trespassers or road/bus accidents. \nHowever the nature and effectiveness of these \nmechanisms varies. These mechanisms need to \nbe made more inclusive as far as children are \nconcerned as well as be more pro-active with \nregard to issues on safety.\n3.2 \nPlanning for Safety\nSchool safety planning needs to be undertaken \nat the district level as well as at the local /school \nlevel. \n3.2.1 \nPlanning at the district level – links \nwith district level DM efforts\nThe District Disaster Management Plans (DDMPs) \nneed to incorporate concerns and solutions for \naddressing safety related gaps in all the schools \nin the district and their surrounding environs. \nMoreover schools often serve as emergency \nshelter locations in the immediate aftermath of a \ndisaster. Hence the DDMAs need to make sure that \nschool safety is given due attention in the DDMPs. \nDDMP should, at the minimum include: \n●\t\nDistrict level baseline of schools \nto be made safer. These can be \nassessed \nthrough \n‘Rapid \nVisual \nScreening’ or any other tool to cover \nall hazards relevant to the area.\n●\t\nProximity of emergency and crisis \nservice agencies , their capabilities \nand consequently their expected \nresponse time; \n●\t\nPhysical \ncapacity \nof \nschool \ninfrastructure and facilities to resist \nknown hazards that are relevant to \nthe local context; \n●\t\nInformation \nrelated \nto \nexisting \nresources \nand \ncapacities \nwithin \nthe school and the community with \nregard to disaster management; \nSection 3",
      "16\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\n● \nThe figure on page 15 articulates various \ndimensions of school safety as part of the \nWhole School Development Plan(WSDP) \nfrom \nthe \nperspective \nof \nthe \nSchool \nCommunity:\nFire Prevention and Fire Safety \nFire Prevention and Fire Safety measures should \nbe part of initial school design, and also require \nregular maintenance and testing. The following \nmust be ensured:\n• \nFlammable \nand \nhazardous \nmaterials \nsources are limited, isolated, eliminated, \nor secured. This includes electrical lines \nand appliances, heaters and stoves, \nnatural gas pipelines and LPG canisters, \nflammable or combustible liquids;\n• \nExit routes are clear to facilitate safe \nevacuation in case of fire or other \nemergency;\n• \nDetection and alarm systems (especially \nurban set ups) are working;\n• \nFire extinguishers are regularly refilled;\n• \nOther fire materials and equipment are \nregularly maintained;\n• \nElectrical systems are maintained and \noperable, in compliance with fire safety \ndesign criteria (Source: Adapted from IFC \nEHS Guidelines)\n3.3.3 \nLeveraging \nexisting \nflagship \nprogrammes \nto \nmake \nschool \ncampus safer \nAreas that have a history of disaster risk recognize \nthe value of schools both during an emergency \nas well as for helping children achieve a sense of \nnormalcy in the aftermath of a disaster. Therefore \nschools are a valuable asset for any community \nfor the various purposes they serve not only for \nchildren but for their families and communities. \nTherefore, local authorities need to have a strong \nsense of urgency for ensuring school safety. \nIn addition, schools can be instrumental in \ncreating an overall ‘culture of safety’ within the \nneighboring community through children and \nteachers. Hence, the relevance of school safety \nefforts goes much beyond the school itself.\nSchool safety cannot be ensured by the efforts of \nthe school authorities alone. The broader context \nof the school has a vital role to play in ensuring \nsafety since school precincts and the facilities \ntherein are provided through different schemes \nand programmes. Often these schemes and \nprogrammes are rather disconnected with the \nschool affairs and special needs of children. \nSSA also recognizes, “..following the micro-\nplanning exercise, the blocks and districts should \nundertake an exercise to see which requirements \ncan be fulfilled either by redeployment /\nrationalisation of existing resources or through \nother schemes of the Central/State Governments. \nThe SDP may be appraised by the Cluster level \nunits, in consultation with the Block teams. The \nDistrict unit will appraise the Block level plans \nwhich will form the basis of the district plan…” \n(SSA Framework for Implementation, 2009, \npp 138)\nThe School Development Plan detailing possible \nsources of funding for different components \nof school safety including SSA, Backward \nAreas Grant Fund, National Rural Employment \nGuarantee Scheme, Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan, \nTribal Areas Sub-Plan, MPLAD etc. needs to be \nshared with Panchayati Raj Institutions / Urban \nLocal bodies and other local level institutions \nfor their participation and support. Components \nof the School Development Plan that can be \nincluded in the Panchayat Plans for Backward \nAreas Grant Fund, National Rural Employment \nGuarantee Scheme, etc. need to be subsequently \nfollowed up with the relevant departments along \nwith the PRIs/ Urban Local Bodies so that they \nare executed in a timely fashion with the desired \nquality– with a focus on children and a focus on \nsafety.\nThose activities that the school can undertake \non its own such as non-structural mitigation \nmeasures for instance, clearing evacuation \nroutes and addressing loose hanging objects, \nneeds to be taken up by the Department of \nSchool Education.\n3.4  \nCapacity Building for Safe \nSchools\nA critical enabler for promotion of safety at the \nschool level is deeper understanding, sensitivity \nand overall capacity of the concerned stakeholders \nin relation to the issue of school safety. \nSection 3",

      "36\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nAnnexure – 2\nEfforts on School Safety in India\nThe agenda of School Safety, as is visible in India today is preceded by the efforts of different \ngovernments in the country to promote the constitutional mandate of providing access to free \nand compulsory education for all children up to the age of 14 years. This was followed up in the \nNational Policy of Education (NPE) and the Programme of Action (POA) 1992 that led to a number \nof schemes and programmes including Operation Blackboard (OB); Non Formal Education (NFE); \nTeacher Education (TE); Mahila Samakhya (MS); State specific Basic Education Projects like the \nAndhra Pradesh Primary Education Project (APPEP), District Primary Education Programme (DPEP) \nand currently the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA). The mandate of SSA goes beyond provision of \neducation alone per se; rather it aims to provide ‘useful’ and ‘quality’ elementary education to \nall children in the 6 -14 age group. About 33% funds of SSA are spent on civil works including \nconstruction of schools, additional classrooms and Block Resource Centres / Urban Resource \nCentres / Cluster Resource Centres. These are designed in line with the Whole School Development \nPlan that includes a focus on safety. For children over the age of 14, the Rashtriya Madhyamik \nShiksha Abhiyan has been launched.\nDisaster Management was introduced as a subject in the Central Board school curriculum, as well \nas several State Education Boards. A Handbook on School Safety was developed by the Ministry \nof Home Affairs in 2004.\nThe GoI- UNDP Disaster Risk Management Programme (DRM) launched in 2002 was one of the \nlargest community-based disaster risk management programmes in Asia. In order to generate \nawareness among students and teachers on how to respond to disasters, a component on School \nSafety was developed under the DRM Programme. The prime objective of this initiative was “school \nsafety through education and building safer schools”. It brought together children, teachers and \nschool managers through participatory activities that concern children’s safety during disasters. \nUnder this component, School level disaster management plans were developed and capacity \nenhancement programmes including mock-drills were conducted for School Community. Extensive \ndisaster management trainings were conducted for teachers, school managers and education \ndepartment officials from Central and State Boards of Secondary Education. In total, 125,817 \nteachers were trained on Disaster Management at the district level. The Programme reached out \nto 4105 schools with 130,000 enrolled children. (Source: UNDP, 2007).\nIn parallel, the work of the UN bodies, several NGOs and INGOs have provided many useful \nlessons in developing the substantive aspects of the agenda.\nThe school safety agenda has thus evolved over the years. What initially was seen as a simple \nprovision of (child friendly) classrooms to protect children from the elements so that their education \nprogresses uninterrupted, expanded to look at structural safety, non-structural mitigation as well \nas capacity building of the larger school community for promoting safety.\nExtracts from a communication from Ministry of Finance regarding Revision of EFC \nFormat to address disaster management concerns in all the programmes and schemes \nof the government.\nAs per a communication from Ministry of Finance to all Ministries and Departments (ref no. 37(4) \n/ PFII/ 2003) of 19th June 2009, the Expenditure and Finance Committee (EFC) Note for approval \nof all ongoing and new programmes and schemes need to answer the following questions:\n“ 3F) Does the project involve any creation/modification of structural/ engineering assets including \nland reclamation or changes to existing land use plans? If yes, then the costs involved in prevention \nand mitigation of disaster(s) (natural and man-made) would need to be included fully in the \nproject cost.\nAnnexure",

List preventive measures enshrined \nin regulations which are to be complied with and confirm compliance.\nd) \nBased on the prioritization of risks, the mitigation measures being contemplated, both \nstructural and non-structural. Confirmation that the implementation of the selected mitigation \nmeasures will not create new risks.\ne) \nConfirmation that the design and engineering of the structure has taken into consideration \nthe National Building Code 2005, the appropriate BIS Codes and the NDMA guidelines. Other \nsources such as Indian Road Congress Manual, Ministry of Road Transport, Highways and \nShipping manual, Railway Board manual, Central Public Health Engineering Organisation \n(Min. of Urban Development) manual, Central Electricity Authority manual and Central \nWater Commission manual etc. may also be consulted where applicable.\nf) \nHas the cost of disaster treatment/mitigation measures been included in the \noverall project cost?\ng) \nAlso indicate that the whole process of risk assessment has been done based on available \ninformation and secondary evidence and the mitigation measure(s) are in conformity with \nthe statutory and other regulatory requirements and are the most viable ones in the present \ncircumstances.”\nThere has been a major revision in the requirements of the Expenditure and Finance \nCommittee (EFC) of Ministry of Finance, Government of India for approval of ongoing and new \nprogrammes and schemes of all the Ministries. Since 2009, the EFC note to be submitted by all \nministries includes a well defined set of questions with regard to disaster management. \nThe SSA Framework for Implementation has been revised in light of the RTE Act and a \ndedicated chapter on School Infrastructure has been provided. The chapter clearly brings out \nthe need and importance of Disaster Resistance in Schools and also gives norms and codes to be \nreferred.\nFurther, Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan Institutions have specified the space norms and appropriate \nsizes for school classrooms etc. in Kendriya Vidyalaya schools that are administered by the \nSangathan. \nRashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) guides the expansion strategy for Secondary \nSchools & Higher Secondary Schools. To provide access to secondary school for students, RMSA \nproposes up-gradation of upper primary schools through construction of classrooms laboratories, \ncomputer rooms, headmaster room, library rooms, separate toilets for girls and boys, appointment \nof additional teachers and strengthening of existing secondary schools. This scheme identifies \nEnvironment Management as an important aspect for improving quality and improving access \nof secondary education. It makes a reference to location/site selection related issues, and \nissues related to design pertaining to the difficult sites. RMSA also makes a reference to special \npurpose designs, construction related impacts, and issues related to provision and maintenance \nof facilities.\nKasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas (KGBV) scheme was launched by the Government of \nIndia in August, 2004 for setting up residential schools at upper primary level for girls belonging \npredominantly to the SC, ST, OBC and minorities in difficult areas. Initially it ran as a separate \nscheme, but was merged with the SSA with effect from 1st April, 2007. With the RTE Act, 2009 \ncoming into force with effect from 1st April 2010, and the SSA Framework of Implementation \nbeing revised to correspond to the RTE Act, the KGBV component of SSA is being implemented \nAnnexure",

      "National Disaster Management Authority\n1\n1.1 \nOverview\n1.1.1 \nThe tradition of boat navigation in India has a long cultural history which dates back \nabout 6000 years ago, when the art of navigation was originated from river Sindh \n(Indus). The word “Navigation” is derived from a Sanskrit word “Nav Gatih”. Ancient \nliteratures and scriptures provide several accounts of navigation in river channels and \nsmall waterways. The ‘Rig-Vedic’ period Aryans were well aware about the river and \nsea navigation routes across the country. They were skilled to construct and operate \nboats in a scientific manner.\n1.1.2. \nThe Indian subcontinent is characterized by typical hydro-meteorological set up with \ndense network of rivers system. The country is surrounded on three sides by seas \nwhich are connected with interior drainage network of rivers, thus making enabling \nenvironment for inland waterways for transportation esp. in coastal regions. Many of \nthe coastal states are endowed with natural harbors stretches along 5700 kms long \ncoastlines that act as big commercial transit point in the country.       \n1.1.3. \n In many of the states, where inland water transport through rivers and their tributaries \nis a lifeline for many people, over aged boats ply overcrowded not only with people, \nbut also vehicles, animals and other goods of daily needs. In the aftermath of Dhubri \nferry tragedy in 30th April, 2012 on river Brahmaputra that accounted for a loss of \nover 250 lives, it was recognized that passenger boats accidents are on the increase \nin various states leading to the loss of lives of scores of people .It was also discovered \nthat most of the boat tragedies were on account of overloading and other related \nfactors. There are thousands such boats plying in the country’s inland waterways with \nno authentic checks on the validity/permits. Whenever any boat accident occurs, \nthe reason often points to poor training, dangerous working practices, inadequate \nregulation and near non-existent enforcement as the root causes for this and similar \nlosses of life. Sometimes boat accidents also take place during adventure sports \nBoat Navigation-Status  \n& Context\n1",
      "Boat NavigatioN-StatuS & CoNtext\n3\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n \nThe rapid expansion of railway network and increase in canal irrigation resulted in \nthe decline of cheap river and canal transportation in the waterways of the region. \nThough the Upper and the Lower Ganga canals were built to serve the dual purpose of \nirrigation and navigation, neither of them carries any traffic now. The same condition \nof extinction also occurred in the Sutlej waterways.\n \nEast India is a land of mighty rivers which often damage railway lines and roads during \nthe rainy season. Volumes of consumer goods, fertilizers for tea plantations, and \nmachinery leave Calcutta for Assam by steamers which pass through Bangladesh. \nTwo such inland waterways are between Kolkata and Dhubri as well Kolkata and \nKarimganj. The river Hooghly in West Bengal is an important waterway in east India. \nCargo services also operate regularly between Haldia and Patna. \n \nThe rivers on the Indian Plateau are not suitable for navigation because there is very \nlittle water in the streams during the long dry months. Some distributaries of the \ndeltas of the Krishna, the Godavari and the Mahanadi are navigable. In the middle \nof the last century, irrigation cum-navigation canals were constructed in the deltas \nof the Godavari and Krishna. The canals are particularly suitable means of transport \nhere in view of the difficulty in constructing rail and road bridges on numerous \ndistributaries in the delta regions. These canals now carry a sizable portion of goods \nand passenger traffic. They are inter-connected and, also join the Buckingham Canal \nwhich runs southwards to Chennai and extends for 106 km even beyond Chennai. \nThus, Vijayawada is connected with Chennai by this navigable canal, but fast running \ntrain again has affected adversely the goods and passenger traffic carried by this canal. \nThe Buckingham Canal connects some lagoons and is meant purely for navigation. \nThe coastal lowland of Kerala State is served with navigable canals which also connect \nmany lagoons. The canals are used extensively by country boats for transporting \ngoods like coconut, cashew-nut, pepper and raw rubber. Inland water transport is \nalso important in Goa.\n1.2.2 \nInland Waterways- Economic & Social Context\n \nThe Inland Water Transport (IWT) in India is considered as one of the cost effective, \nrelatively fuel efficient, and environment friendly means of transportation. This also \nprovides livelihoods to many people living along the river courses. India is among \nthose counties where new initiatives are being undertaken to make better use of the \nexisting capacity of Inland waterways transportation. Several development projects \naimed towards the enhancement of inland water transportation infrastructures are",

Subsequently, the issue of duplicate \ndocuments was initiated free of cost (Annexure VII).\n8.4  Camps for issuing duplicate documents were planned for 14-day duration i.e. from December \n14 to 28, 2015. These camps were run from 8 AM to 6 PM. Principal Secretary (Admn.) was \nappointed as the monitoring ofﬁ cer and other IAS ofﬁ cers were appointed as nodal ofﬁ cers \nto ensure smooth functioning of these camps. Special camps were organised at the Taluka \nlevel for issue of certiﬁ cates to persons who lost them in the ﬂ oods. Arrangements were \nalso made to receive applications for replacement of such documents at Common Service \nCentres. Formats of Applications for various documents are at Annexure VIII to XIII.\n8.5  Affected people had to apply for issuance of duplicate documents in the camps in requisite \nformats, which were made widely available. No FIRs for the lost documents were required \nto be ﬁ led. Applications were to be compulsorily made on standardised bilingual application \nforms, which were given to the applicants free of cost. Applications submitted thus were \nacknowledged (on a card), thoroughly veriﬁ ed by the respective departments and duplicates \nwere issued within two weeks. Individuals were informed on their mobile numbers to collect \ncopies of duplicate certiﬁ cates/ documents on their becoming ready for delivery.\n8.6  A decentralised decision-making approach was adopted by nodal ofﬁ cers for taking on-the-\nspot decisions.\nHighlight of the visit-Major Observation\n8",

Various modes of communication were used to make them aware about these \ncamps. Auto rickshaw – based speaker announcements were made too, to ensure that the \nmaximum number of affected people make use of these camps.\n8.9  At each of these camps, two reception desks were established for guiding the applicants. \nIn Chennai, a total of 51,654 applications were received for issuing duplicate certiﬁ cates/ \ndocuments (details are at Table 3). All these applications were scrutinized and relevant \ndocuments were provided to the applicants. These camps, conducted in all ﬂ ood-affected \ndistricts, were a major success.\n8.10 In Kancheepuram, a total of 42,810 applications were received in these camps. While a \nmajority of applications (37,001) were successfully disposed, 5,809 applications were \nrejected for want of certain procedural lapses or information mismatch. It may be noted \nhere that out of 5,809 rejected applications, 4,112 were pertaining to Family Card/Ration \nCard (details are at Table 4). A detailed scrutiny of these applications through the data \navailable with the Fair Price Shops under Public Distribution System (PDS) brought out the \nfact that a lot of duplicacy of information had happened. Many applicants had multiple \nration cards and the information provided by them had accuracy issues. Based on the inputs \ngiven by Fair Price Shops, only genuine applicants were issued duplicate ration cards.   \n8.11 College students also raised their concern about their college certiﬁ cates which were lost \nor mutilated due to ﬂ ood water. However, during these camps College certiﬁ cates were not \nissued as it involved different Universities.\n8.12 Village Administrative Ofﬁ cers (VAO) helped people who did not know the survey number/\npatta number. Computers from taluka ofﬁ ces along with printers were brought to the camps \nto help people with the patta numbers.\n8.13 Applications were entertained even if the applicant’s original documents were registered \nin a different taluka.

      "14\n10.1  Each disaster presents an opportunity to learn from it. The Tamil Nadu Government used the \nopportunity presented to it after the December 2015 deluge to strengthen disaster preparedness \nin the State. A year later, in December 2016, the city was face-to-face with another extreme \nweather event, the tropical Cyclone Vardah. This time around, the government had put in place \npreparedness measures to deal with any freak rainfall, ﬂ ood, cloudburst, drought or cyclonic storm \nincident well in advance. Accordingly, Tamil Nadu SDMA vide Letter No. NC1 (4)/5779/2016, \ndated 04.10.2016 issued an Order to all District Collectors and Greater Chennai Corporation \nwith consolidated instructions to be followed for North East Monsoons 2016 complete with a \ncheck list and formats for reporting the implementation and progress of various measures weekly \n(Annexure XIV). This greatly minimized loss of lives as rescue and evacuation operations could \nbe effectively organized. Massive restoration efforts were launched and the infrastructure was \nbrought back to normalcy within a very short time.\n10.2  Key highlights of the preparedness measures taken to mitigate the impact of Vardah Cyclone and \nNorth East Monsoons during 2016 are as follows:\n• \nSpecial drive to clean channels leading to water tanks is undertaken before the monsoon \nseason.\n• \nGaps between Government and Private Sector efforts were bridged. Private companies came \nforward, post-disaster, for repairing vehicles, re-phasing loans and personnel management.\n• \nThe State Government had convened a meeting with all Stakeholders to discuss their \ncontingency plans which ensured pre-emptive deployment of response forces. Additional \nTeams of NDRF, SDRF and Columns from Army, Navy and Coast Guard were mobilized and \npre-positioned in vulnerable areas.\n• \nSimilar meetings were held at the district and state level to sensitize hospitals, educational \nand industrial organizations, communication service providers and Oil Companies etc. \nsensitizing them to be equipped with institutional strategies for immediate response during \ndisasters. They were also sensitized to make back-up arrangements to ensure continuity of \nlife saving services, especially in the hospitals. \n• \nA coordinated approach covered timely evacuation and minimum casualties. \n• \nPower supplies were turned off during ﬂ oods/cyclonic storms.\n• \nDiesel Generators (DG) were shifted to elevated level/upper ﬂ oors. DG sets of mobile service \noperators were damaged during 2015 ﬂ oods as they were installed in the basements.\n• \nSufﬁ cient diesel/oil stock with power/oil/telecom companies with proper storage facilities \nat safe locations. While only BSNL had enough stock during 2015, each of these service \nproviders had enough stock during the 2016 North East Monsoon.\nApplication of Key Lessons Learnt \n10",
      "16\n11.1  Besides immediate relief measures, Govt. of Tamil Nadu had also undertaken a slew of long-term \nmeasures to prevent the recurrence of a similar disaster situation in the future. These initiatives \naddress the fundamental causes underlying such catastrophes and can easily be contextualized \nfor major cities across the country.\n• \nMaster Plan 2030, drawing lessons from the 2015 deluge, is under preparation. This will \nresult in an institutional framework to manage disasters of such magnitude by way of a long-\nterm plan.\n• \nLong-term conservation and response plans are being drawn.\n• \nRegulation of tanks/reservoirs is being prepared.\n• \nClassiﬁ cation and subsequent mapping of both rural/urban areas to decide their vulnerability \nto ﬂ ooding depending on inundation: 5ft. and above water - high vulnerability; 2-3 ft. water - \nmoderate vulnerability, less than 2 ft. water - low vulnerability. \n• \nPlans to deploy unmanned vehicles (drones) for aerial photography.\n• \nProposal to equip SDRF with cranes of 100 tonnes capacity to remove blockages due to water \nhyacinths.\n• \nUAV photogrammetry of all rivers in rural areas.\n• \nSea-side Storm Surge Modelling.\n• \nStudy the designed discharge capacity of tanks as it may have cascading effects on breaching \nof tanks.\n• \nA compendium of water resources to be made public.\n• \nConstitute Inter-Departmental Teams with Team Leaders for pre-inspection and monitoring \ndesignated areas.\n• \nIdentify escape routes to the nearest relief shelter on vulnerability maps. \n• \nHospitals were asked to prepare their emergency plans.\nOther Measures Taken for Better Preparedness\n11",
      "17\n• \nDo not depend only on ﬁ eld ofﬁ cers for getting information.\n• \nNeed for deployment of boats strategically near vulnerable/low-lying areas during monsoons. \nPre-positioning of lorries and JCBs, etc. too needs to be done in consonance with vulnerability \nof the area.\n• \nNeed to deploy Aapda Mitra at every level for preparedness.\n• \nNeed to train youngsters as ﬁ rst responders. Integration between these ﬁ rst responders and \nofﬁ cial response teams at the local level should be ensured.\n• \nNeed to set up additional emergency operation centres.\n• \nPublic Interest Litigations (PILs) should not be entertained within a speciﬁ ed period (say within \n15-30 days of any such event) to ensure that relief and rescue work are not hampered.\n• \nNeed to maintain all records electronically. In Tamil Nadu, these records are available both \nwith the Revenue and the IT Department.\n• \nOverall infrastructural improvements as preparedness and/or mitigation measure.\n• \nAvailability of multiple-channel HAM radios for uninterrupted communication despite \ncommunication network breakdown during a disaster. Ofﬁ cials/front-line responders/ \ncommunity responders should also be trained on how to use HAM radios.\n• \nDocumentation of best practices.\n• \nNeed to revise Disaster Management Plans.\n• \nRemoval of encroachments on river banks, timely inspection before each monsoon cycle.\n• \nGenerators are needed in all taluka ofﬁ ces for power back up. Water supply also gets disturbed \ndue to lack of power.\n• \nNeed for special cattle ponds to cater to their needs as well as preventing spread of diseases \nthrough community ponds.\n• \nCivil supplies corporations should maintain sufﬁ cient stocks and should be able to move \nthem swiftly whenever needed.\n• \nOnly one designated ofﬁ ce/ofﬁ cer/spokesperson should give out information to the media. \n• \nSoil analysis and land use pattern should be taken into account while planning for urban ﬂ ood \nmitigation in any city/town.\n• \nA policy should be made regarding a standard family kit that will be delivered to the affected \nfamilies in case of a disaster. \n• \nPublic awareness on disasters needs to be created with a community-based participatory \napproach to disaster risk reduction.\n• \nInformation from the Meteorological Department needs to be made user-friendly.\n• \nSuggestive Formats for issuing duplicate copies of various Documents (Annexure XV to \nXVIII).\nSuggestive Measures Based on Tamil Nadu Experience\n12",
      "18\nSpeciﬁ c Recommendations for Government of Tamil Nadu\n13\n• \nA high-level expert committee for Chennai city should be formed. This committee should be \ngiven adequate authority to take decisions on-site to appropriately regulate and release water \nfrom upstream lakes/tanks keeping in view hydrological and meteorological forecasts issued for \nthe region. During heavy rainfall, this committee should have a ﬁ nal say on releasing water from \nlakes/tanks/water bodies on the basis of reviewing the inﬂ ow forecasts.\n• \nChennai city should develop its own network of Automatic Weather Stations (AWS), say one \nstation for every four sq. km., for effective monitoring of rainfall and issuing of warnings. These \nshould be used in conjunction with satellite map animations, IMD warnings and ﬂ ood forecasting \nsoftware. It should address sudden thunderstorm ﬂ ooding (20 mm/hr to 120 mm/hr), rapid \nmoving weather disturbances, heavy rains due to various factors, etc.\n• \nDocumentation of best practices and sharing the same in public domain so that other States \nmay learn and mitigate risks of ﬂ ooding based on Chennai’s experience. This may also help other \ncountries, especially the developing nations of Asia, plan ﬂ ood rehabilitation efforts.",

Thus a need was felt at the policy level to formulate \nguidelines on boat and navigational safety in consultation with the concerned states \nand stakeholders. The guidelines would be an effort to make enabling reference for \nstates/UTs in streamlining passenger boat navigation in the established waterways \nthrough inception of a set of regulatory and structural framework.\n1.1.4. \nThe prime responsibility of the maintenance of safety in boat transport functionally \nlies with boat operators and wharf (ghat) management authorities; however, the \nadministrative and socio-economic controls are enjoyed by state/district authorities \n.The guidelines is also an effort to sensitize boat operators, passengers, local authorities \nand other stakeholders about the dangers of unsafe navigation practices and potential \ndisaster threats   \n1.2 \nIndian Waterways  – Brief Outline\n1.2.1 \nInland Navigation- There are several waterways in India suitable for inland navigation, \nbut the lower Ganga and the Brahmaputra waterways are specifically suited due to \ntheir distinct advantages like gentle gradient, appropriate depth of water and flow \nthrough densely populated regions. In addition, the tropical nature of climate doesn’t \nallow freezing of water, which provide suitability of navigation throughout the year \nat the cheaper rate .However, due to seasonal nature of rainfall; fluctuation in water \nlevel is greater. Before 1854, there was no railway lines in the entire stretch of the \nGangetic plains, thus goods and passengers had to travel through country boats in \nrivers like the Ganges & the Brahmaputra. The emerging commercial centers during \nthose periods were also preferred to be located near river banks. The cities like Kanpur \nand Patna established due to such suitability. The “Steam Navigation” was introduced \nin 1830, which became very popular particularly in the lower Ganga waterways till \nthe construction of railways was started in 1885 after which the number of country \nboats and cargoes declined gradually in these routes due to the preponderance of rail \ntransportation of goods and passengers which were comparatively safer and faster. \nThus the steam navigation also declined considerably. In addition, the water levels \nin these navigational routes declined considerably after the opening of Lower Ganga \ncanal in 1878 and other canals subsequently. The repeated famines in subsequent \nyears led to the diversion of more waters from these waterways to the water deficit \nregions that led the further decline in water level in these rivers thus greatly affected \nwaterways navigation in these regions.",

The work of formulation and dissemination of flood forecasts under various \ninter-state river basins is carried out directly by 27 Flood Forecasting Divisions which \nare designated as Divisional Flood Control Rooms (DFCR). Flood forecasts are issued \n6 to 24 hours in advance depending on the travel time available between base station \nto FF station and available time of concentration up to flood forecasting stations. \nCWC has also started rainfall based mathematical modelling to generate 3-day flood \nadvisories for all the flood forecasting stations for 2017 monsoon.\n \nThere are two types of forecast issued by CWC – Stage forecast or level Forecast \ngives information about water level in rivers and Inflow forecast provides information \nabout the likely amount of inflow into the dams /barrages.

      "14\n10.1  Each disaster presents an opportunity to learn from it. The Tamil Nadu Government used the \nopportunity presented to it after the December 2015 deluge to strengthen disaster preparedness \nin the State. A year later, in December 2016, the city was face-to-face with another extreme \nweather event, the tropical Cyclone Vardah. This time around, the government had put in place \npreparedness measures to deal with any freak rainfall, ﬂ ood, cloudburst, drought or cyclonic storm \nincident well in advance. Accordingly, Tamil Nadu SDMA vide Letter No. NC1 (4)/5779/2016, \ndated 04.10.2016 issued an Order to all District Collectors and Greater Chennai Corporation \nwith consolidated instructions to be followed for North East Monsoons 2016 complete with a \ncheck list and formats for reporting the implementation and progress of various measures weekly \n(Annexure XIV). This greatly minimized loss of lives as rescue and evacuation operations could \nbe effectively organized. Massive restoration efforts were launched and the infrastructure was \nbrought back to normalcy within a very short time.\n10.2  Key highlights of the preparedness measures taken to mitigate the impact of Vardah Cyclone and \nNorth East Monsoons during 2016 are as follows:\n• \nSpecial drive to clean channels leading to water tanks is undertaken before the monsoon \nseason.\n• \nGaps between Government and Private Sector efforts were bridged. Private companies came \nforward, post-disaster, for repairing vehicles, re-phasing loans and personnel management.\n• \nThe State Government had convened a meeting with all Stakeholders to discuss their \ncontingency plans which ensured pre-emptive deployment of response forces. Additional \nTeams of NDRF, SDRF and Columns from Army, Navy and Coast Guard were mobilized and \npre-positioned in vulnerable areas.\n• \nSimilar meetings were held at the district and state level to sensitize hospitals, educational \nand industrial organizations, communication service providers and Oil Companies etc. \nsensitizing them to be equipped with institutional strategies for immediate response during \ndisasters. They were also sensitized to make back-up arrangements to ensure continuity of \nlife saving services, especially in the hospitals. \n• \nA coordinated approach covered timely evacuation and minimum casualties. \n• \nPower supplies were turned off during ﬂ oods/cyclonic storms.\n• \nDiesel Generators (DG) were shifted to elevated level/upper ﬂ oors. DG sets of mobile service \noperators were damaged during 2015 ﬂ oods as they were installed in the basements.\n• \nSufﬁ cient diesel/oil stock with power/oil/telecom companies with proper storage facilities \nat safe locations. While only BSNL had enough stock during 2015, each of these service \nproviders had enough stock during the 2016 North East Monsoon.\nApplication of Key Lessons Learnt \n10",

This committee should be \ngiven adequate authority to take decisions on-site to appropriately regulate and release water \nfrom upstream lakes/tanks keeping in view hydrological and meteorological forecasts issued for \nthe region. During heavy rainfall, this committee should have a ﬁ nal say on releasing water from \nlakes/tanks/water bodies on the basis of reviewing the inﬂ ow forecasts.\n• \nChennai city should develop its own network of Automatic Weather Stations (AWS), say one \nstation for every four sq. km., for effective monitoring of rainfall and issuing of warnings. These \nshould be used in conjunction with satellite map animations, IMD warnings and ﬂ ood forecasting \nsoftware. It should address sudden thunderstorm ﬂ ooding (20 mm/hr to 120 mm/hr), rapid \nmoving weather disturbances, heavy rains due to various factors, etc.\n• \nDocumentation of best practices and sharing the same in public domain so that other States \nmay learn and mitigate risks of ﬂ ooding based on Chennai’s experience.

      "In developing countries like India, schools \nare often located in vulnerable areas and \nunprepared to respond to emergencies. In recent \nyears, schools in India have witnessed many \ncatastrophic incidents: a fire led to the deaths of \nover 400 people —about half of them students—\nat a school’s prize giving ceremony in Dabwali \nHaryana in 1995; In 2001 a total of 31 teachers \ndied and 95 were injured; 971 students perished \nand 1,051 were injured in the Bhuj Earthquake, \nGujarat. Formal education was disrupted due to \nwidespread damage to physical infrastructure. \nMany of the buildings collapsed and many \nother were declared unfit for use. Many of these \nbuildings had been poorly constructed, lacked \nearthquake resistant features and were badly \nmaintained. A fire at the Lord Krishna School \nin Kumbakonam, Tamilnadu took the lives of \n94 children in 2004; thousands of students \nand teachers were killed, injured or otherwise \naffected in the 2004 South Asia Tsunami; and 15 \nchildren and 3 teachers died in a boat accident \nduring a school picnic at Kerala in 2007. \nEducation, public awareness and proper training \nfor enhancing the capacity is the cornerstone \nof approaches aimed at reducing vulnerabilities \nto natural hazards. The Hyogo Framework for \nAction 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of \nNations and Communities to Disasters, adopted \nat the World Conference on Disaster Reduction, \nhighlights knowledge and education as one of the \nfive main priorities of action. Attention should be \naccorded and support given to efforts targeting \nschool children and youth with the aim of making \npeople more aware of the threat of hazards and \nof the need and possibility to become better \nprepared before disasters strike.\nTowards this end, Government of India has \napproved a National School Safety Programme \n- a Demonstration Project to be implemented \nby National Disaster Management Authority  \n     To promote a culture of disaster \npreparedness in the school\n• To initiate policy level changes for ensuring\nsafe school environment.\n• To sensitize children and the school \ncommunity on disaster preparedness and \nsafety measures.\n• To motivate direct participation of key \nstakeholders in activities that would \nhelp building towards a disaster resilient \ncommunity.\n• To promote capacity building of officials, \nteachers and students.\n• To carry out Information, Education and \nCommunication (IEC) activities in schools and \nassociated environment.\n• To implement non-structural mitigation \nmeasures in select schools.\n• To carry out demonstrative structural \nretrofitting in select  schools.\nBackground\nVision\nObjective\n(NDMA) in partnership with Ministry of Human \nResource \nDevelopment \n(MHRD) \n, \nState/\nUT Governments, National and International \nAgencies in 43 districts of 22 States /UTs of the \ncountry falling in seismic zone IV & V .",
      "3\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\n1.1 \nDisasters as a critical threat to \nthe well-being of children\n'Disasters’, are defined as “a serious disruption \nof the functioning of a community or a society \ncausing widespread human, material, economic \nor environmental losses which exceed the ability \nof the affected community or society to cope \nusing its own resources”1. Due to a range of \nfactors, including age, physical ability, gender, \nhealth conditions and, dependency on care \ngivers, many children are extremely vulnerable \nin the event of a disaster. Such events cause \na serious disruption in their healthy growth \nand development as well as overall well-being. \nExperiences of fear, violence, separation from \nparents and caregivers, exploitation and abuse, \nare some of the key risks that children face. \nMoreover, the loss of livelihood of their families \ncan lead to homelessness and extreme poverty. \nAs with other infrastructure, schools are also \nexposed to disaster risk. Disasters have not \nonly challenged the government and other \nstakeholders in providing access to education but \nalso endangered the lives of children and those \nengaged in the pursuit of education.\nThere is enough evidence to reflect that the \nquality of school premises and existing capacities \nof the stakeholders have a bearing on a child’s \nvulnerability to disaster risks. Annexure 1 \nprovides details on the number of lives lost and \nthe extent of damage to school premises in some \nof the major disasters globally and nationally.\nGiven the fact that children are expected to spend \nmajority of their time at school, safe schools \nattain very high importance with a view to \nensuring their safety and well being. Schools can \nbe a safe haven for children that help them slowly \nmove back to normalcy. Within the safe school \npremises, essential supplementary nutrition for \nchildren can be provided, along with safe water \nand sanitation facilities especially for adolescent \ngirls and boys. Thus there is a global consensus \nthat schools should be resumed at the earliest in \nthe aftermath of a disaster \n1.2  \nUnderstanding School Safety\n‘School Safety’ has been defined as the creation \nof safe environments for children starting from \ntheir homes to their schools and back. This \nincludes safety from large-scale 'natural' hazards \nof geological/climatic origin, human-made risks, \npandemics, violence as well as more frequent \nand smaller-scale fires, transportation and other \nrelated emergencies, and environmental threats \nthat can adversely affect the lives of children.2 \nThe concept has evolved over the last couple of \ndecades as the threat to the physical well being \nof children has become more visible both globally \nand in the country. \nThe Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) \n2005-2015; building the Resilience of Nations \nand Communities to Disasters, adopted at \nthe World Conference on Disaster Reduction \nunderlines the importance of knowledge and \neducation as one of its five main priorities. It \ndraws attention to school children and youth \nwith the aim of making the community at large \nmore aware of the threat of hazards and become \nbetter prepared.\nThe concept of school safety in its current \nform includes safety issues both inside and \noutside the school. It includes issues of child \nprotection and safety that look at all forms of \nviolence and deprivation that affect the physical \nand mental wellbeing of children. As it stands \ntoday therefore, School Safety is a concept \nIntroduction\n1\n1. http://www.unisdr.org/eng/library/lib-terminology-\neng%20home.htm on 13 October 2013.\n2.

It recognizes \nthat “every person below the age of eighteen \nyears as a child and that childhood is an integral \npart of life with a value of own, and long term, \nsustainable, \nmulti-sectoral, \nintegrated, \nand \ninclusive approach is necessary for the harmonious \ndevelopment and protection of our children”. The \nPolicy has identified survival, health, nutrition, \neducation, development, protection (including \nfrom emergencies/disasters) and participation as \nthe undeniable rights of every child, and has also \ndeclared these as key priority areas. \nNational Disaster Management Act (2005): \nThe National Disaster Management Act 2005 \nlays down the institutional, legal, financial \nand \ncoordination \nmechanisms \nfor \nDisaster \nManagement (DM) at the national, state, \ndistrict and local levels. Through the National \nInstitute of Disaster Management, the Act \nenvisages promotion of safety awareness among \nstakeholders including teachers and students.\nNational Policy on Disaster Management \n(NPDM), 2009: The National Policy on Disaster \nManagement 2009 highlights the need for \nstructural as well as non- structural safety in \nschools and educational institutions. In the \nchapter on Techno-legal Regime, in section 6.4.1, \nthe Policy identifies school buildings as a national \npriority and enables provision for designing the \nschool buildings/hostels with earthquake resilient \nfeatures and equip them with appropriate fire \nsafety measures. In the chapter on capacity \ndevelopment under section 10.2.2, the policy \nalso emphasizes upon disaster management \ntraining in all educational institutions including \nschools. Section 10.5.1 makes a reference to the \nrole of National Cadet Corps (NCC) and scouts \nand guides in schools and colleges for disaster \nmanagement related work. Section 10.6.1 of \nNPDM discusses the introduction of subject of \ndisaster management in the curriculum through \nthe Central and State Boards of Secondary \nEducation. \nNational Policy on Education (NPE) 1968, \nRevised in 1992, the National Policy on \nEducation calls for a \"child-centred approach\" \nin primary education, but does not contain a \nspecific reference to school safety or disaster risk \nissues of children.\nRight to Education Act 2009: Right to Education \n(RTE) Act 2009 guarantees free and compulsory \neducation to all the children in the country till \nthe age of 14. The Act sets minimum norms and \nstandards with regard to location and quality \nof schools and in Clause 19, lays down that no \nschool shall be established, or recognized unless \nit fulfils the norms and standards specified in the \nschedule. One of the key standards is in relation \nto access to “all weather buildings”; in “areas \nwith difficult terrain, risk of landslides, floods, \nlack of roads and in general, danger for young \nchildren in the approach…the State Government \n/ Local Authority shall locate the school in such a \nmanner as to avoid such dangers”. The Act lays \ndown the formation of the School Management \nCommittee for planning of infrastructure and \nother requirements with respect to operational \nfunctioning of schools. The School Development \nPlan, as laid out by the Act, spells out the  \nphysical requirements of additional infrastructure \nand equipments to meet the norms spelt out in \nthe schedule (in relation to all weather buildings). \nThe RTE Rules provide detailed guidance on \nimplementation of the Act on the ground.\n1.4 \nScope of the Guidelines:\nThe National School Safety Policy Guidelines \ndraw the attention of the decision makers on \nschool education in India (both government and \nprivate) upon the urgent need to strengthen risk \nresilience of schools in rural as well as urban areas \nof the country. It is hoped that this document will \nbe useful for these institutions to ensure that all \nschool children across the country remain safe \nfrom any kind of disaster risk as they access their \nright to education.\n3.

      "12\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nIn addition, each district should designate the \nBlock Education Officer or any other official as \nappropriate, for over-seeing and facilitating \nschool safety at the block level.\n3.1.2 \nInstitutional Strengthening at the \nLocal Level for Preparedness and \nResponse \nAt the local level, both in rural as well as urban \nareas, the school community broadly includes \nchildren, \nschool \nteachers, \nthe \nPrincipal \n/ \nHeadmaster and parents. These are the primary \nstakeholders of the school affairs and may be \nrepresented formally or informally in decision \nmaking bodies for the school. It is imperative \nthat these existing institutions at the school level \nare strengthened, and their potential adequately \ntapped for ensuring wellbeing of children and \nteachers from a disaster safety perspective. \nUnder the SSA, the School Management \nCommittee has been designated as the body \nresponsible for managing the affairs of the school in a \ntransparent and “bottom – up” participatory manner.\nThe School Management Committee needs to \nbe made responsible for taking on the safety \nagenda at the community and school level. The \nSchool Management Committee needs to be \nsensitized and oriented on their expected role.\nAt the school level, a School Safety Focal \nPoint Teacher (FPT) needs to be nominated \nto operationally anchor safety related actions \nat the school level as part of his / her routine \ncommitments in the School. The School Safety \nFocal Point Teachers also need to be provided \nthe necessary training to anchor the process and \nfoster action by different stakeholders responsible \nfor various activities. \nThe School Management Committee in each \nschool should be adequately trained for different \naspects of school safety in case of an imminent \ndisaster/emergency, e.g. sanitation and hygiene \nneeds of boys, girls and teachers; first aid; \nstampede \nmanagement; \nfire \nmanagement \nand control, handling of chemicals /hazardous \nmaterials in labs etc.\nEach school should also identify and develop a \ncadre of peer educators / trainers for ensuring \nthat safety messages, dos and don’ts of different \ndisasters, procedures and protocols, reach each \nand every student in the school. These peer \neducators can be trained through National Cadet \nCorps, National scouts and guides camps, by \nthe Red Cross or any other agency as deemed \nfit by the district.\nMany private schools have in place mechanisms \nto address everyday issues in relation to school \nexpansion and development, fire drills, power \noutage procedures, early dismissals on account \nof unexpected weather events, health and safety \nconcerns, trespassers or road/bus accidents. \nHowever the nature and effectiveness of these \nmechanisms varies. These mechanisms need to \nbe made more inclusive as far as children are \nconcerned as well as be more pro-active with \nregard to issues on safety.\n3.2 \nPlanning for Safety\nSchool safety planning needs to be undertaken \nat the district level as well as at the local /school \nlevel. \n3.2.1 \nPlanning at the district level – links \nwith district level DM efforts\nThe District Disaster Management Plans (DDMPs) \nneed to incorporate concerns and solutions for \naddressing safety related gaps in all the schools \nin the district and their surrounding environs. \nMoreover schools often serve as emergency \nshelter locations in the immediate aftermath of a \ndisaster. Hence the DDMAs need to make sure that \nschool safety is given due attention in the DDMPs. \nDDMP should, at the minimum include: \n●\t\nDistrict level baseline of schools \nto be made safer. These can be \nassessed \nthrough \n‘Rapid \nVisual \nScreening’ or any other tool to cover \nall hazards relevant to the area.\n●\t\nProximity of emergency and crisis \nservice agencies , their capabilities \nand consequently their expected \nresponse time; \n●\t\nPhysical \ncapacity \nof \nschool \ninfrastructure and facilities to resist \nknown hazards that are relevant to \nthe local context; \n●\t\nInformation \nrelated \nto \nexisting \nresources \nand \ncapacities \nwithin \nthe school and the community with \nregard to disaster management; \nSection 3",

For private and unaided \nschools, the National Accreditation Board for \nEducation and Training needs to monitor safety \naspects. In addition, as per the DM Act, DDMA \nneeds to monitor all school buildings for their \ncompliance with building codes.\nFor schools under SSA, the current process \nof preparation of annual School Development \nPlans needs to reinforce focus on safety \naspects. \nA \ncomprehensive \nassessment \nof \nneeds, conducted prior to the development of \nthe School Development Plan (SDP) is essential \nfor identifying the possible risks for children as \nwell as their capabilities to respond and recover \nfrom critical incidents. The assessment should \nconsider the history of natural disaster risk in \nthe area and natural vulnerabilities, physical \nfactors, such as the location of the school with \nregard to existing / emerging hazards, for \nexample flooding due to proximity of a water \nbody, building code requirements in relation \nto school structures as well as non-structural \ncomponents that may threaten the well-being \nof children. It should also consider emergency \nuses of the school facility such as, school being \ndesignated as a relief shelter in the District \nDisaster Management Plans.\nThe School Management Committee members, \nchildren and teachers being the primary users \nof the school are in the best position to identify \nand plan for addressing hazards and risks that \nmay threaten their safety. Once the School \nManagement Committee has been formed and \noriented to school safety issues, a dedicated group \nof individuals is available to lead the process of \nidentifying risks and vulnerabilities. \nAny appropriate tool may be used to conduct the \nprocess of identifying needs in a participatory \nmanner. For instance, ‘Hazard hunt’ exercise is a \ntested method to identify risks, both inside and \noutside the school precincts that may threaten \nthe safety of the school community. It involves \nidentifying all kinds of hazards including those that \ncan cause physical harm such as deep potholes, \nlack of boundary walls; those that affect the \nhealth of children such as contaminated water \nsources, absence of toilets and hand washing \nfacilities; as well those factors that are outside \nthe school per se such as fast moving traffic on \nthe road outside, ponds etc. (Refer Annexure 7)\nBased on the assessment of needs, the School \nDevelopment Plan needs to be prepared by the \nSchool Management Committee. NDMA through \nSDMA and DDMA will provide standard tool kits \nand render other inputs to facilitate the process. \n(Format of School DM Plan is available as \nAnnexure 8)\nThe plan would comprise measures to be taken \nboth within school premises and in the immediate \nneighborhood including:\n1. \nShort term interventions : both non-\nstructural and structural activities\n2. \nLong- term interventions : both non-\nstructural and structural activities\n3. \nTraining plan: For students and teachers \n4. \nKnowledge \nbuilding \nplan \nincluding \nawareness creation, mass sensitization, \nmock-drills including follow up through \nregular school timetable. This would also \ninclude the use and regular maintenance \nof emergency equipments such as fire \nextinguishers.\n5. \nReview and Monitoring plan including \nsafety audit, availability of emergency \nequipment and materials\nSection 3",
      "14\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nSSA also mentions, “..School Development Plan \nshould emerge from a process of micro planning \nundertaken \nin \na \nparticipatory \nmanner..The \npreparation of the School Development Plan may \nbe undertaken by a core team, led by a School \nManagement Committee member from the village/\nhabitation, and comprising selected community \nleaders, NGO representatives, Head Teacher, \nselected teachers and parents, especially parents \nof children from disadvantaged groups and \nweaker sections, and children with special needs... \nand would include, inter alia.. preparation of a \nproposal for improved education facilities..” (SSA \nFramework for Implementation, 2009, pp 137)\nIn parallel, the plan also needs to be consulted/ \nbrought in picture with the village Panchayat \nfor exploring opportunities for leveraging other \nschemes.\n3.2.3 \nSchool Disaster Management Plan\nSchools \nshould \nalso \ndevelop \na \nDisaster \nManagement \nPlan \ndefining \nprocedures \nto \nconfine, contain, consolidate and control the \nemergency and crisis, with inputs from DDMA.\nThis plan should include among other aspects, \nsystem of warnings, communication protocols \nwithin and outside the school (including usage \nof public addressal system), identification of \nevacuation routes, access by emergency vehicles \nand care of children with special needs. The \nDisaster Management Plan should also include \nstock piling of emergency equipment and \nmaterials, regular maintenance of emergency \nequipment, arrangements for orderly release \nof students to guardians and temporary shelter, \nin case required. A site map should be included \nin the plan, designating planned evacuation \nroutes and assembly areas. The same should be \ndisplayed on each floor of the school. A copy of \nthe plot map and floor plan for each school with \nthese details should be submitted to the DDMA \nfor inclusion in the DDMP.\n3.3 \nImplementation \nof \nsafety \nactions\n3.3.1 \nAppropriate Siting, Design and \ndetailing for structural safety in new \nschools and repairing of existing \nschools\nAll existing as well as new schools need to \nconform to safety standards as per the National \nBuilding Code. In addition, any other norms \nprescribed by the state government need to be \nadhered to. (Refer Annexure 6)\nSome of these actions are given below:\n● \nNew schools should be located, on a site \nthat has adequate mitigation measures \nalready in place against any imminent \nnatural hazards. Existing schools located \nin a vulnerable location should either be \nrelocated at a safer site or they should \nbe provided adequate support to mitigate \nthe effect of any natural hazards that may \naffect the area.\n● \nAll \nnew \nschool \nconstructions \nshould \ninclude disaster resilient features. Existing \nvulnerable schools need to be repaired to \nthe desired level of resilience with regard \nto local disaster risks.\n● \nPrescribed designs may be adapted to \naccommodate safety and child friendly \nfeatures.\n● \nFor design of structural standards of school \nbuilding and its components such as \ncorridors, staircases, side areas, quality of \nconstruction should be as per the National \nBuilding Code 2005. Only non-combustible, \nfire-proof, heat resistant materials shall be \nused in school construction.\n● \nVertical expansion of existing schools \nshall not be carried out without a fitness \ncertificate for the building from a certified \ncivil / structural engineer.\n● \nAdditional \nclassrooms \nor \nany \nother \nstructures requiring horizontal expansion \nshall be designed taking into account the \nspace availability and while constructing as \na continuous unit to the existing structures, \nthese should be designed to have less \nimpact of seismic forces.\n● \nEach class room should have two doors \nfor easy evacuation; adequate openings \nfor ventilation and lighting are some of \nthe essential elements that need to be \naccommodated in the design.\n● \nDoors opening outside, into open areas or \ncorridors of adequate width are key details \nthat need to be incorporated to make \nschools safer. \nSection 3",
      "15\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nAll of these and any other additional ones, \nrequire the guidance and support of a panel of \ntechnical agencies to be identified at the state \nlevel and designated to work in specific districts. \nIn this manner location specific designs can be \nworked out with adequate attention to safety \nfeatures as well as child friendly elements. \nBesides these details, other design solutions \nin line with the Whole School Development \nConcept need to be incorporated to promote \nsafety and child friendly features. Elements \npertaining \nto \nschool \nsafety \nshould \nbe  \nincluded in the whole school development \napproach.\n3.3.2 \nNonstructural safety measures in \nschools\nBesides structural safety measures, non structural \nelements within the school campus need to be \naddressed to ensure safety. These are mostly low \ncost, regular maintenance items that the school \nshould address on a regular basis from their own \nfunds. Some of these items have been listed \nbelow:\n● \nAll items of furniture such as almirahs, \nshelves, black boards etc., as well as any \nother items that may fall and cause injury \nto students and teachers such as ceiling \nfans, coolers, water tanks etc. need to be \nsecured to the walls or floor.\n● \nAny electrical items such as loose wires \nthat may cause an exigency should be \naddressed promptly by the school.\n● \nChemical and any hazardous materials \nin \nthe \nschool \nlaboratory \nshould \nbe  \nhandled and stored as per instructions to \nprevent any harm to students and school \nstaff.\n● \nOpen \nareas \nincluding \ncorridors \nand \nevacuation routes including staircases and \nramps should be kept free from any hurdles \nand barriers so that evacuation is smooth \nand swift.\n● \nPots / planters in the play ground or \ncorridors should be kept in a manner that \ndoes not affect smooth evacuation\n● \nAny derelict or unused building, rubble, etc. \nshould be removed to prevent any harmful \nanimals or pests from accessing children. \n● \nTraffic movement outside the school should \nbe managed to minimize risk to students \nat the time of assembling and dispersal of \nschool. \n● \nDuring excursions, schools should carefully \nchoose the location of excursion and the \nitinerary so that exposure to hazard is \nminimized. Extra precautions should be taken \nwhen students are being taken close to water \nbodies, narrow mountainous tracks etc.\n● \nBuses or any other vehicles owned / hired by \nthe school need to be maintained properly \nso that students are not at risk of accidents. \nDrivers need to be appropriately trained on \nspeed limits, stoppage of vehicles as well as \ncrisis management so that children remain \nsafe during their travel to and from schools. \n● \nEmergency \nequipment \nsuch \nas \nfire \nextinguishers, first aid kits, ropes etc. need \nto be procured and maintained regularly by \nthe School Authorities. \nVarious Dimensions of School Safety – building on the Whole School Development Approach\nSection 3",
      "16\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\n● \nThe figure on page 15 articulates various \ndimensions of school safety as part of the \nWhole School Development Plan(WSDP) \nfrom \nthe \nperspective \nof \nthe \nSchool \nCommunity:\nFire Prevention and Fire Safety \nFire Prevention and Fire Safety measures should \nbe part of initial school design, and also require \nregular maintenance and testing. The following \nmust be ensured:\n• \nFlammable \nand \nhazardous \nmaterials \nsources are limited, isolated, eliminated, \nor secured. This includes electrical lines \nand appliances, heaters and stoves, \nnatural gas pipelines and LPG canisters, \nflammable or combustible liquids;\n• \nExit routes are clear to facilitate safe \nevacuation in case of fire or other \nemergency;\n• \nDetection and alarm systems (especially \nurban set ups) are working;\n• \nFire extinguishers are regularly refilled;\n• \nOther fire materials and equipment are \nregularly maintained;\n• \nElectrical systems are maintained and \noperable, in compliance with fire safety \ndesign criteria (Source: Adapted from IFC \nEHS Guidelines)\n3.3.3 \nLeveraging \nexisting \nflagship \nprogrammes \nto \nmake \nschool \ncampus safer \nAreas that have a history of disaster risk recognize \nthe value of schools both during an emergency \nas well as for helping children achieve a sense of \nnormalcy in the aftermath of a disaster. Therefore \nschools are a valuable asset for any community \nfor the various purposes they serve not only for \nchildren but for their families and communities. \nTherefore, local authorities need to have a strong \nsense of urgency for ensuring school safety. \nIn addition, schools can be instrumental in \ncreating an overall ‘culture of safety’ within the \nneighboring community through children and \nteachers. Hence, the relevance of school safety \nefforts goes much beyond the school itself.\nSchool safety cannot be ensured by the efforts of \nthe school authorities alone. The broader context \nof the school has a vital role to play in ensuring \nsafety since school precincts and the facilities \ntherein are provided through different schemes \nand programmes. Often these schemes and \nprogrammes are rather disconnected with the \nschool affairs and special needs of children. \nSSA also recognizes, “..following the micro-\nplanning exercise, the blocks and districts should \nundertake an exercise to see which requirements \ncan be fulfilled either by redeployment /\nrationalisation of existing resources or through \nother schemes of the Central/State Governments. \nThe SDP may be appraised by the Cluster level \nunits, in consultation with the Block teams. The \nDistrict unit will appraise the Block level plans \nwhich will form the basis of the district plan…” \n(SSA Framework for Implementation, 2009, \npp 138)\nThe School Development Plan detailing possible \nsources of funding for different components \nof school safety including SSA, Backward \nAreas Grant Fund, National Rural Employment \nGuarantee Scheme, Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan, \nTribal Areas Sub-Plan, MPLAD etc. needs to be \nshared with Panchayati Raj Institutions / Urban \nLocal bodies and other local level institutions \nfor their participation and support. Components \nof the School Development Plan that can be \nincluded in the Panchayat Plans for Backward \nAreas Grant Fund, National Rural Employment \nGuarantee Scheme, etc. need to be subsequently \nfollowed up with the relevant departments along \nwith the PRIs/ Urban Local Bodies so that they \nare executed in a timely fashion with the desired \nquality– with a focus on children and a focus on \nsafety.\nThose activities that the school can undertake \non its own such as non-structural mitigation \nmeasures for instance, clearing evacuation \nroutes and addressing loose hanging objects, \nneeds to be taken up by the Department of \nSchool Education.\n3.4  \nCapacity Building for Safe \nSchools\nA critical enabler for promotion of safety at the \nschool level is deeper understanding, sensitivity \nand overall capacity of the concerned stakeholders \nin relation to the issue of school safety. \nSection 3",
      "18\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nThe School Management Committee needs \nto be trained on assessment of safety needs, \ndeveloping plans as well as safety audit which \nneeds to be conducted quarterly. This includes \nchecks to ensure that facilities and resources \nwithin the school are maintained viz. safe water \nand sanitation, first aid kits, fire extinguishers etc. \nDisaster Management in Core Curriculum \nDedicated actions for building the capacity of \nstudents and staff in schools are needed to create \na “culture of safety” within the larger community \nto which the students and teachers belong. This \n“culture of safety” would be an outcome of the \ncollective efforts of the educational institutional \nmachinery with other institutions concerned \nwith disaster risk such as the State and District \nDisaster Management Authorities. \nOn their part, Central Board of Secondary \nEducation, State Boards of Secondary Education \n(SCERT), and other institutions involved in \ncurriculum development need to include age \nappropriate theoretical as well as practical \nknowledge on risk of disasters, nationally and \nspecifically about their own state.\nPractical training on health promotion and disease \nprevention \nconcepts \nand \nhealth-enhancing \nbehaviors and life skills is important.\nList of Trainings required for promotion of \nschool safety is available in Annexure 3\nPeer Education and Use of Child Friendly \nMethods\nThe strategy of peer–to-peer education is a \ntested strategy for imparting specific knowledge \non disasters such that it reaches each and every \nstudent within the school.\nThis strategy not only promises extended \noutreach, it also facilitates the development \nof leadership skills in the students at school \nand within their community. Peer education \nfor disaster management may be extended to \npeer mediation in cases of bullying or any other \nincidences of violence that can be resolved by \nstudents themselves.\nIt is also important to ensure that appropriate \nchild friendly techniques are used in the process \nof skill building. Use of songs, skits, puppet \nshows, drawing competitions, quiz competitions, \nessay/ slogan writing and demonstration are \nproven ways of transferring knowledge and \nskills to children.\n3.5 \nRegular monitoring of risk and \nrevision of plan\nImplementation of National School Safety Policy \nGuidelines needs to be monitored at the national \nlevel jointly by MHRD and NDMA. At the state \nlevel, implementation of the Guidelines needs \nto be monitored by State Education Department \nand SDMA.\nSSA Framework offers broad guidelines on \nprovisioning of School Infrastructure facilities. \nTherefore, suitable indicators to monitor disaster \nrisk to children may be developed/monitored by \nthe State Governments based on their specific \nconditions in assistance with SDMAs.\nThe education machinery at State/district level \nneeds to strengthen their efforts at promoting \nschool safety for aided as well as private schools. \nThe District Education Officer must ensure that \n‘Recognition Certificate’ under sub-rule (4) 15 \nof Right of Children to Free and Compulsory \nEducation Rules, 2010 is issued only to those \nschools that comply with safety norms laid out \nin the Building Codes. This compliance needs to \nbe monitored on a regular basis. In addition, a \nmechanism needs to be evolved by the District \nEducation Officer and any other Regulatory \nAuthorities for monitoring safety parameters \nin all schools on a regular basis. Any existing \nmonitoring formats being used by the Authorities \nshall essentially include parameters on school \nsafety.\nIn addition, each district should designate the \nBlock Education Officer or any other official as \nappropriate, for overseeing and facilitating school \nsafety at the block level.\nTo ensure that schools remain ‘safe’ for the \nstudents and the teachers, it is important that \nthe School Development Plans are reviewed \nand updated regularly by School Management \nCommittee on a quarterly basis. There could be \ncases of unaddressed hazards and additional \nnew hazards that emerge in the course of the \nimplementation of the School Development \nPlan. These will be integrated into the School \nDevelopment Plan through the process of \nreview and up-dation. In addition, there may be \nrisks that have to be monitored periodically to \nsafeguard the health and well-being of children, \nsuch as cleanliness of toilets and quality of \ndrinking water.\nSection 3",

In 2008 Haiti earthquake, half of the schools in the country was destroyed \n(Reliefweb 2008). The Sichuan Earthquake in 2008 caused collapse of over 7,000 school buildings \n(Reliefweb, 2008).  The 2005 Kashmir earthquake resulted in collapse of over 8000 schools on both \nsides of the border; altogether over 18000 children lost their lives while at school (BBC 2005).\nA fire led to the death of about 200 children at the prize giving ceremony at a school in Dabwali, \nHaryana in 1995; a total of 31 teachers died and 95 were injured.  During the 2001 Gujarat Earthquake \nover 11,600 schools were destroyed/ damaged; 971 students perished and 1,051 were injured. \n(World Bank 2001). Similarly the fire at Lord Krishna School in Kumbakonam, Tamilnadu caused \ndeath of 94 children and thousands of students and teachers were impacted in South India in the \naftermath of the 2004 Tsunami.\nCause for such state of affairs has largely been poor quality of construction, lack of disaster \nresilient features and poor maintenance of schools. The fact remains that schools are indeed \nspaces where children and teachers spend a large part of their day. Therefore the quality of these \nspaces has a bearing on their vulnerability to disaster risk.\nAnnexures\nAnnexure",
      "38\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nin the overall context of child rights and child entitlements and in harmony with the spirit and \nstipulations of the Act. \nNational Building Code of India (NBC), published by Bureau of Indian Standards in 2005 serves \nas a Model Code for adoption by all agencies involved in school construction works. The Code \nattributes an ‘importance factor’ to ascertain the structural design of different types of building, \ndepending on the functional use of the structure, characterised by hazardous consequences of its \nfailure, its post-earthquake functional need, historic value, or economic importance. In section \n5.3.4, the Code attributes Importance Factor of 1.5 to Schools, higher than all other buildings \nindicating the importance of schools. \nHon’ble Supreme Court of India has also come out with its judgment in support of school safety, \nand insisted on adherence to NBC standards in school building specifications and construction. \nIn its judgment of April13, 2009 on Writ Petition (Civil)no. 483 of 2004, the court has recognized \nthat “Right to education incorporates the provision of safer schools” and given direction on several \naspects of school safety including : \na) \nFire Safety Measures in Schools (Point 3.1 page 23)\nb) \nTraining of School Teachers and other Staff (Point 3.2 page 25)\nc) \nSchool Building Specifications (Point 3.3 page 27)\nd) \nClearances & Certificates (Point 3.4 page 29)\nIn response to Writ Petition (Civil) no.483 of 20044 , the court held that “Evaluation of structural \naspect of the school may be carried out periodically…the concerned engineers and officials must \nstrictly follow the National Building Code. The safety certificate be issued only after proper \ninspection. Dereliction in duty must attract immediate disciplinary action against the concerned \nofficials.”\nIn addition to policy interest in addressing structural aspects of safety, there have been changes \nin the school curriculum as well. The SSA, Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and state \nboards have introduced disaster education in curriculum for school education. \nThe most recent initiative by the government was the National School Safety Project \nimplemented by NDMA in 43 districts of 22 states of the country. The Programme, essentially pilot \nin nature, had the following components:\ni. \nFormulation of National School Safety Policy.\nii. \nCapacity building (Development of model school DM plan, including format for Mock drill; \nReview and approval of School DM Plans in selected schools; development of training \nmodules for training of state level master trainers, training of teachers and students)\niii. \nInformation, Education and Communication (Development of model templates for IEC material \nas well as Translation and printing of IEC material in local language and dissemination of IEC \nmaterial in all the schools)\niv. \nNon- Structural Mitigation Measures (Development of non-structural mitigation guidelines / \nchecklist for Rapid Visual Survey and implementation of such measures in project schools)\nv. \nDemonstrative Retrofitting\nState Government Initiatives \nGovernment of Assam has made it compulsory for all schools to have a Disaster Management \nPlan on the lines of a Model Disaster Management Plan uploaded on the official website of \nthe Secondary Education Department. Amendments are also being made in the Assam Non-\nGovernment Educational Institutions (Management & Control) Act, 2006 to make it compulsory \nfor all Non-Government Educational Institutions to adopt construction approved by GMC/GMDA \nAnnexure",
      "39\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nwith appropriate design. There is also an amendment to make it compulsory to hold mock drills at \nregular intervals. Fire extinguishers are also being provided to every school in the state.\nGovernment of Gujarat, initiated two programs namely Gujarat School Safety Initiative– I & II, \nfor promoting a culture of disaster safety in schools and reduce risk through structural and non-\nstructural measures in the schools. The programme focused on 152 schools in Phase I covering \n1,00,000 students (primary and secondary standards) and 1,500 teachers on the basics of disaster \nmanagement. As part of the long-term sustainability of the program, an assessment of non-\nstructural mitigation measures was completed and school safety clubs have been opened in all \nthe project schools. In Phase II, Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority is working towards \ncreation of cadre of master trainers and a pool of trained teachers at district level in disaster risk \nreduction across all the 25 districts of the State.\nGovernment of Himachal Pradesh, as part of the State Education Code 2013, has issued \ninstructions to all schools in the state for preparation of their own disaster management plan, \nwhich captures school specific hazards, vulnerabilities, resources and plan for mitigation. Detailed \nguidelines have also been issued for conducting mock drills, development of School Safety Plans \nand School Fire Safety DM Plan. The state has also developed a range of audio-visual materials for \nraising awareness on safety issues among children. All of these activities have been carried out as \npart of the GoI – UNDP DRR programme 2009 - 2012. As part of another initiative retrofitting of \nfew schools has also been carried out in the state. \nGovernment of NCT of Delhi, in its circular No. F.16/Estate/CC/Fire Safety/2011/3298 to \n3398 passed on 01/03/2011, issued directions to schools specifically with regard to fire safety. \nThese include detailed directions for different types of buildings for access, number of doors in \na class room, staircases, fire extinguishers, use of basement and captive water storage for Fire \nFighting and pumping arrangements. In the General measures, directive is laid out on the use of \nnon-combustible material for construction of the school building, maintenance of escape routes, \nstorage of LPG cylinders in the laboratories and electrical circuits.\nGovernment of Tamil Nadu, has issued G.O. Ms.No.131, Department of School Education, in \ncontinuance to G.O.Ms.No.1179, Public (law and orders) Department dated 20.7.2004. The order \nfollows from the Commission of enquiry for the incident of death due to fire accident at Sri Krishna \nAided Primary School at Kumbakonam, Thanjavur District on 16-07-2004. With regard to school \nsafety, the Commission made specific recommendations. A thorough review of the recognition / \napproval granted to the existing schools has to be undertaken. With reference to those schools \nwho have not obtained permission / approval / recognition, strict compliance with the micro level \nfulfillment of norms should be ensured by the Inspecting Officer concerned, through physical \nverification before recommending for permission / approval / recognition. \nPeriodical monitoring through spot inspection towards upkeep of the infrastructure has to be \nensured. Crash Training course for the teacher on crisis management and first aid is recommended. \nThe state has issued additional orders in 2012 suggesting measures to be followed for the safety \nof children studying in schools in all government / government aided and private schools in Tamil \nNadu. These include structural safety measures, safety precautions with regard to open wells, \nwater tanks, septic tanks and staircases etc. The order also talks of safe drinking water provision \nas well as safe sanitation facilities. In addition, safe electrical connections, seating arrangements, \nassembly class room environment and infrastructure, school vehicles and first aid have been \ncovered. \nGovt. of Haryana: State Policy on Safety Measures in Schools: The state has come out with \na specific policy concerning safety measures in schools.

Higher Level of preparedness for disaster helps to \nminimise the loss of life and prevention of injures caused particularly during earthquakes for which \nthere is no warning. However certain other hazards like flood, cyclone etc. do have early warning \nsystem thereby giving some time for taking response. Children being the future of tomorrow should be \nensured a safe learning environment and prepared well to respond effectively during disasters. To put \nthis into practice it is recommended that every school constitutes a School Level Disaster Management \nCommittee along with sub committees to ensure better preparedness and response in disasters. The \nvarious committees constituted in a school will comprise of members from among teachers, non \nteaching staff as well students.

      "Proceedings of the Consultation Workshop National Programme on Forest Fire Management \nThe Consultation Workshop was started by the opening remarks of Sh. Kunal Satyarthi, \nJoint Secretary, Policy and Plan Division, NDMA. He explained the backdrop of the workshop \nand emphasised the importance of having a nationwide program on Forest Fire Management. The \nworkshop is aimed at collecting inputs and realizing the ground truth in Central Indian states \nwhere maximum area of forest is burnt every year. The forests of Central India are highly prone to \nforest fire and any management initiatives should be incomplete without addressing the Central \nIndian scenario.  \nHe added that forest fire management is a multi-departmental issue. As it is considered a \nNational Disaster as per the National Disaster Management Plan (2019) more departments and \norganizations such as NDRF, SDRF, Fire Service, IIFM, TFRI, FSI etc. will all be involved in the \npreparedness s, mitigation as well as response of forest fire. He opined that SDRF should train \ntheir staff in forest fire fighting in line with the NDRF as they are forming 3 battalions exclusively \nfor forest fire response.  \nSince most of the forest fires in India are ground fires aerial fire fighting has its own \nlimitations and is not cost efficient. He explained the reason why Ministry of Home Affairs and \nMinistry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change are coming forward with this National \nProject on forest fire management and Central India, especially Madhya Pradesh which is a leader \nin the burnt area every year can play a lead role in making it a success over a long period of time \nthat too in a sustainable way. \nDr. K Ravichandran, Director, IIFM, Bhopal welcomed the chief guest and other \ndignitaries to the workshop. He also welcomed all the participants form stakeholder organizations \nand other states. He congratulated the NDMA for taking initiative for drafting National project on \nforest fire management. He expressed his concern about land use change which in turn is fuelling \nthe forest fire. Since trees sequestrate more carbon, forest fire play and important role in climate \nchange also. So there is a need of robust mechanism to combat forest fire. He added that \nstakeholders should come forward for more workshops like this and trainings on the fire related \nissues and make it a regular knowledge appraisal process.  \nSh. Ramesh Kumar Gupta, PCCF & HoFF, Madhya Pradesh delivered the presidential \naddress and expressed his gratitude for conducting the workshop In Madhya Pradesh.  He said \nMadhya Pradesh is the state having largest area burnt by forest fire every year. Joint Forest",
      "Management Committees and 1500 forest dwelling villages in the state are playing a major role in \ntackling forest fire. He also added that fire is good servant and a bad master. He complimented the \nidea to consider forest fire as a disaster and mentioned countries like USA, Australia have all \nmade this move. The alert systems by FRI and funding from CAMPA should be enhanced in \naccordance with the escalation in forest fire incidences.  \nSh. J. N. Kansotiya, Additional Chief Secretary, Forest Department, Madhya Pradesh \ninaugurated the workshop and said that this is very important subject and fire is experienced more \nin months of April- June. Burnings for Mahua flower collection is one of the major reasons of \nforest fire in the state. He added that there is a need of proper study on forest fire on its origin. \nThere should be use of technology and resources. He added that awareness, community \nparticipation, discussions with forest department, training modules, equipment and budget at \ndistrict level should be there. Sensitization and coordination with students can be done to prevent \nlocal fire. \nDr. Ajit Kumar Shrivastava, Nodal Officer (Forest Fire), MP discussed about budget \nprovided by MoEFCC for fire management. He shared some techniques that are being used in fire \nmanagement like fire ball and fire extinguisher vehicles. He also added that portals of FSI like \nAgni portal and studies of TFRI in forest fire are very important in the development of this field. \nThe inaugural session was followed by the presentations of the participating stakeholders. \n1. Best Practices in Forest Fire Management –Chhattisgarh, Shri O P Yadav, Nodal \nOfficer (Forest Fire) Chhattisgarh. \nHe shared basic information of forests in Chhattisgarh. It is the 3rd largest state in terms of \nforest and 80 percent of villagers of Chhattisgarh live within 5 km from forest boundaries. Most of \nthe forest fire happens between mid-February and mid-June.  He also shared that Chhattisgarh is \nvery sensitive for fire given the human interactions near to forest area. Since 2017, after the \nintroduction of SNPP in fire detection by FSI, there is an increase in the number of incidences. \nBijapur, Sukuma and Narayanpur are the most fire prone districts. They also have high number of \nregistrations for the forest fire alert system. Chhattisgarh also have a state monitoring committee \nfor supervising and reviewing the forest fire management activities.  He said that 6 lakh people are \nengaged in Mahua flower collection and 14 lakh families involve in collection of Tendu leaves. \nThe major limitations faced by the forest department are shortage of manpower and lack of \nenough funds. Some areas facing left wing extremism are hard to manage in a forest fire",
      "perspective. There is requirement of front-line staff. As of now only one watcher is available per \nforest beat. Employing more forest watchers along with fighting equipment, terrain, accessibility \nand lack of vehicles. \nDuring the discussion Shri Kunal Satyarthi enquired about the solution to the Mahua and \nTendu leaf issue. The suggestion was to create more awareness among the community and to \npromote the collection of food grade Mahua flower which is superior to the one collected by \nburning forest floor. \nDr. Ajit Kumar Shrivastava opined that the use of drones can be used as an innovation to \nmonitor the Mahua and Tendu leaf collection.  \nShri Ramesh Kumar Gupta added that there are new techniques in place for Tendu leaf \ncollection without burning and these needs to be established in every region. \n2. Best Practices in Forest Fire Management – Maharashtra Shri Akshay Ghajbiye IFS \nHe said that there are many reasons for forest fire but forest fire and tendu leaves collection \nhas very direct correlation with each other. He talked about technological approaches and \nhumanistic management. Extensive use of GIS and remote sensing in management of forest fire is \nhelping now for better understanding and management. He also talked about the importance of \nfire line maintenance. He said that their team is working to monitor forest fire and have state level \ncommand control room at head office. The Tendu contractors are held responsible by contract if \nany fire occurs in the area allotted to them. Their labourers are also made available for fire-\nfighting if any in that region. At district level all foresters are registered in FSI alert system. They \nare also working on prevention strategies and pre-fire works with instruments and have also \ncreated fire cells at divisional level. 6m, 12m, and 30m fire lines are maintained with respect to \nthe fire proneness of the area. They are focussing on awareness to villagers for reducing fire with \nincentive distribution system like “ANGAR MUKT JANGAL SPARDHA” by which people are \nmade to participate in forest fire prevention and those successful communities will be provided \ncash price. \nLack of funds and logistics are the main drawbacks in the forest fire management in the state. \nDuring the discussion Shri Kunal Satyarthi enquired about the cost involved in Mahua \ncollection and the incentives given for the community. Shri Akshay Ghajbiye replied that \nincentive scheme gives a maximum of fifty thousand rupees for the winning community.",
      "Dr. P K Mathur opined that the lack of removal activities in Tiger Reserves and other \nprotected areas are causing accumulation of fuel load and will cause severe fires in the future.   \nShri Ramesh Kumar Gupta said that JFMCs are also stakeholders in forest fire management \nand they should also be part of workshops like this in the future. \nDr. Ajit Kumar Shrivastava mentioned about the importance of having a national level \nawareness campaign in line with the Smoky bear campaign of the United States.  \n3. Best Practices in Forest Fire Management Telangana (Sh. Vinay Kumar, Nodal \nOfficer Telangana) \nHe talked about fire vulnerability and land use after fire incidences. Firefighting strategies like \ndetection and alert. He also focused on 11 districts for alert concerning toward and fire \npreparedness for 2023. He requested that necessary actions should be made to allow forest \nvehicles to travel beyond administrative boundaries. The lack of permission for forest vehicles in \ncrossing the national highway is a hinderance in many cases of forest fire management. \n4. Best Practices in Forest Fire Management- Madhya Pradesh (Dr. Ankur Awadhiya \nDCF) \nHere also major reason is identified to be Tendu collection. Burning of agricultural field in the \nmonth of March to April also causes forest fires. They have identified the peak weeks using \nprevious data and weather parameters which helps in better management of resources for \npreparedness. He also added that heatwave (55oC temperature) is responsible for flash of litter \nwhich accumulates the fuel load. He explained the Burn Severity Index developed by them for \nmeasuring fire induced by manmade. He said that their team are working on funds for equipment \nand forest fire alerts are being provided on near real time basis through WhatsApp group of all \nofficials. They have developed forest fire map for every district that are available in the website. \nJFMCs are also engaged in fire management activities. Distributing Mahua collection maps and \ntraining and awareness are being promoted. \nDr P K Mathur commented that many states are not now depending entirely on the alerts \nprovided by the FSI which is a good initiative. \nDr. Ajit Kumar Shrivastava opined that MoEF& CC should make interventions to make \nlaws that prevents leasing of forest fire prone areas for tendu leaf collection.",
      "Shri Shivanand S Talwar, AIG (Forests), MoEF& CC responded that this issue can be \nflagged to the Ministry of Tribal Affairs. \n5. \nDr. Yogesh Dubey, IIFM made a presentation about the role of IIFM in capacity building \nand modules of forest management. \n6. \nDr. Amitabh Panday have shared a diagnostic study of forest fire in Odisha that was \nconducted in tribal based three villages. He showed that NTFPs are not available because of fire \nand health of people, water quality and soil quality are affected by fire. Sifting cultivation also \naffects forest.  He said that 55 percent participants are engaged with management of forest fire. \nThere is also a focus on post fire treatment and soil conservation. \n7. \nShri Dheeraj Gupta, Scientist D, TFRI Jabalpur talked about early warning system on \nforest fire. He said that their team has been working on Graphical user Interface for forest fire \nprediction. And also developed a model (input/output….) and measured hazard level for 21 years. \nThey have counted forest fire for every grid of area. He said that economic losses due to forest \nfire. He also included in his study like assessment of flora and fauna and carbon estimation.  \n8. \nShri Ashutosh Singh, Deputy Ranger, FSI Central Regional Centre, Nagpur shared \nFSI work on real time fire monitoring system. He also explained about the Van Agni Geo Portal \nthat provide forest fire data of the country over the years. They also send email alerts to SDMA \nfor large forest fire detection. They also send SMS alerts to registered users. He talked about fire \ndanger rating system and pre fire alerts.  \n9. \nShri Rajesh Panwar, Deputy Director, National Fire Service College, Nagpur made a \npresentation on the training need analysis. He said that organisation should provide information \non training and skill development to all responders. He focused on forest fire fighting \nrequirements. He put forwarded ideas such as forest fire bunkers and water supply from identified \nwater resources for use at time of fire, and also use of solar pump. He opined that there should be \nclear strategies and techniques in dealing with different types of fire. Bulldozers and tractors also \nuseful in many parts of Central India. He said that fire extinguishing foam and fire blocking gel \ncan be experimentally used. He also added that fire extinguishing powder ball can affect \nagriculture and soil so instead of that water balloon can be used. \nThe following suggestions came up after the discussions \n1. Each and every DFO must try to understand the reason behind fire so that management can \nbe more site specific.",
      "2. District administration should be involving in forest fire management and it should not be \nthe sole responsibility of the forest department. \n3. Controlled burning in protected areas should be made possible otherwise accumulating \nfuel load may cause severe fire in the future. \n4. Involvement of local community representatives must be ensure in future workshops like \nthis. \n5. A National level awareness campaign for forest fire management in line with the “Smokey \nBear” campaign of the Unites states may be adopted. \n6. Available fund can be structured with respect to the proneness to forest fire.  \n7. NDRF getting world’s best equipment in near future will be key in forest fire management. \n8. There is need to be an understanding on how to prepare citizens to participate in fire \nmanagement. Priority should be given for large fires. Inclusion of private organisations \nshould also be considered.  \nThe closing remarks of the session was made by Dr. P. K. Mathur. He suggested that the \nformulation of a structured system for forest fire management in the country is a necessity \nconsidering the climate change scenario. The management of forest fires should be developed \nin a way that it must be self-sustainable even after the time period of the national programme. \nHe thanked all the participants on behalf of the Project Drafting Committee. \nThe meeting ended by 5 PM",

Burnings for Mahua flower collection is one of the major reasons of \nforest fire in the state. He added that there is a need of proper study on forest fire on its origin. \nThere should be use of technology and resources. He added that awareness, community \nparticipation, discussions with forest department, training modules, equipment and budget at \ndistrict level should be there. Sensitization and coordination with students can be done to prevent \nlocal fire. \nDr. Ajit Kumar Shrivastava, Nodal Officer (Forest Fire), MP discussed about budget \nprovided by MoEFCC for fire management. He shared some techniques that are being used in fire \nmanagement like fire ball and fire extinguisher vehicles. He also added that portals of FSI like \nAgni portal and studies of TFRI in forest fire are very important in the development of this field. \nThe inaugural session was followed by the presentations of the participating stakeholders. \n1. Best Practices in Forest Fire Management –Chhattisgarh, Shri O P Yadav, Nodal \nOfficer (Forest Fire) Chhattisgarh. \nHe shared basic information of forests in Chhattisgarh. It is the 3rd largest state in terms of \nforest and 80 percent of villagers of Chhattisgarh live within 5 km from forest boundaries. Most of \nthe forest fire happens between mid-February and mid-June.  He also shared that Chhattisgarh is \nvery sensitive for fire given the human interactions near to forest area. Since 2017, after the \nintroduction of SNPP in fire detection by FSI, there is an increase in the number of incidences. \nBijapur, Sukuma and Narayanpur are the most fire prone districts. They also have high number of \nregistrations for the forest fire alert system. Chhattisgarh also have a state monitoring committee \nfor supervising and reviewing the forest fire management activities.  He said that 6 lakh people are \nengaged in Mahua flower collection and 14 lakh families involve in collection of Tendu leaves. \nThe major limitations faced by the forest department are shortage of manpower and lack of \nenough funds. Some areas facing left wing extremism are hard to manage in a forest fire \n\nperspective. There is requirement of front-line staff. As of now only one watcher is available per \nforest beat. Employing more forest watchers along with fighting equipment, terrain, accessibility \nand lack of vehicles. \nDuring the discussion Shri Kunal Satyarthi enquired about the solution to the Mahua and \nTendu leaf issue. The suggestion was to create more awareness among the community and to \npromote the collection of food grade Mahua flower which is superior to the one collected by \nburning forest floor. \nDr. Ajit Kumar Shrivastava opined that the use of drones can be used as an innovation to \nmonitor the Mahua and Tendu leaf collection.  \nShri Ramesh Kumar Gupta added that there are new techniques in place for Tendu leaf \ncollection without burning and these needs to be established in every region. \n2. Best Practices in Forest Fire Management – Maharashtra Shri Akshay Ghajbiye IFS \nHe said that there are many reasons for forest fire but forest fire and tendu leaves collection \nhas very direct correlation with each other. He talked about technological approaches and \nhumanistic management. Extensive use of GIS and remote sensing in management of forest fire is \nhelping now for better understanding and management. He also talked about the importance of \nfire line maintenance. He said that their team is working to monitor forest fire and have state level \ncommand control room at head office. The Tendu contractors are held responsible by contract if \nany fire occurs in the area allotted to them. Their labourers are also made available for fire-\nfighting if any in that region. At district level all foresters are registered in FSI alert system. They \nare also working on prevention strategies and pre-fire works with instruments and have also \ncreated fire cells at divisional level. 6m, 12m, and 30m fire lines are maintained with respect to \nthe fire proneness of the area. They are focussing on awareness to villagers for reducing fire with \nincentive distribution system like “ANGAR MUKT JANGAL SPARDHA” by which people are \nmade to participate in forest fire prevention and those successful communities will be provided \ncash price. \nLack of funds and logistics are the main drawbacks in the forest fire management in the state. \nDuring the discussion Shri Kunal Satyarthi enquired about the cost involved in Mahua \ncollection and the incentives given for the community. Shri Akshay Ghajbiye replied that \nincentive scheme gives a maximum of fifty thousand rupees for the winning community.  \n\nDr. P K Mathur opined that the lack of removal activities in Tiger Reserves and other \nprotected areas are causing accumulation of fuel load and will cause severe fires in the future.   \nShri Ramesh Kumar Gupta said that JFMCs are also stakeholders in forest fire management \nand they should also be part of workshops like this in the future. \nDr. Ajit Kumar Shrivastava mentioned about the importance of having a national level \nawareness campaign in line with the Smoky bear campaign of the United States.  \n3. Best Practices in Forest Fire Management Telangana (Sh. Vinay Kumar, Nodal \nOfficer Telangana) \nHe talked about fire vulnerability and land use after fire incidences. Firefighting strategies like \ndetection and alert. He also focused on 11 districts for alert concerning toward and fire \npreparedness for 2023. He requested that necessary actions should be made to allow forest \nvehicles to travel beyond administrative boundaries. The lack of permission for forest vehicles in \ncrossing the national highway is a hinderance in many cases of forest fire management. \n4. Best Practices in Forest Fire Management- Madhya Pradesh (Dr. Ankur Awadhiya \nDCF) \nHere also major reason is identified to be Tendu collection. Burning of agricultural field in the \nmonth of March to April also causes forest fires. They have identified the peak weeks using \nprevious data and weather parameters which helps in better management of resources for \npreparedness. He also added that heatwave (55oC temperature) is responsible for flash of litter \nwhich accumulates the fuel load. He explained the Burn Severity Index developed by them for \nmeasuring fire induced by manmade. He said that their team are working on funds for equipment \nand forest fire alerts are being provided on near real time basis through WhatsApp group of all \nofficials. They have developed forest fire map for every district that are available in the website. \nJFMCs are also engaged in fire management activities. Distributing Mahua collection maps and \ntraining and awareness are being promoted. \nDr P K Mathur commented that many states are not now depending entirely on the alerts \nprovided by the FSI which is a good initiative. \nDr. Ajit Kumar Shrivastava opined that MoEF& CC should make interventions to make \nlaws that prevents leasing of forest fire prone areas for tendu leaf collection. \n\nShri Shivanand S Talwar, AIG (Forests), MoEF& CC responded that this issue can be \nflagged to the Ministry of Tribal Affairs. \n5. \nDr. Yogesh Dubey, IIFM made a presentation about the role of IIFM in capacity building \nand modules of forest management. \n6. \nDr. Amitabh Panday have shared a diagnostic study of forest fire in Odisha that was \nconducted in tribal based three villages. He showed that NTFPs are not available because of fire \nand health of people, water quality and soil quality are affected by fire. Sifting cultivation also \naffects forest.  He said that 55 percent participants are engaged with management of forest fire. \nThere is also a focus on post fire treatment and soil conservation. \n7. \nShri Dheeraj Gupta, Scientist D, TFRI Jabalpur talked about early warning system on \nforest fire. He said that their team has been working on Graphical user Interface for forest fire \nprediction. And also developed a model (input/output….) and measured hazard level for 21 years. \nThey have counted forest fire for every grid of area. He said that economic losses due to forest \nfire. He also included in his study like assessment of flora and fauna and carbon estimation.  \n8. \nShri Ashutosh Singh, Deputy Ranger, FSI Central Regional Centre, Nagpur shared \nFSI work on real time fire monitoring system. He also explained about the Van Agni Geo Portal \nthat provide forest fire data of the country over the years. They also send email alerts to SDMA \nfor large forest fire detection. They also send SMS alerts to registered users. He talked about fire \ndanger rating system and pre fire alerts.  \n9. \nShri Rajesh Panwar, Deputy Director, National Fire Service College, Nagpur made a \npresentation on the training need analysis. He said that organisation should provide information \non training and skill development to all responders. He focused on forest fire fighting \nrequirements. He put forwarded ideas such as forest fire bunkers and water supply from identified \nwater resources for use at time of fire, and also use of solar pump. He opined that there should be \nclear strategies and techniques in dealing with different types of fire. Bulldozers and tractors also \nuseful in many parts of Central India. He said that fire extinguishing foam and fire blocking gel \ncan be experimentally used. He also added that fire extinguishing powder ball can affect \nagriculture and soil so instead of that water balloon can be used. \nThe following suggestions came up after the discussions \n1. Each and every DFO must try to understand the reason behind fire so that management can \nbe more site specific.  \n\n2. District administration should be involving in forest fire management and it should not be \nthe sole responsibility of the forest department. \n3. Controlled burning in protected areas should be made possible otherwise accumulating \nfuel load may cause severe fire in the future. \n4. Involvement of local community representatives must be ensure in future workshops like \nthis. \n5. A National level awareness campaign for forest fire management in line with the “Smokey \nBear” campaign of the Unites states may be adopted. \n6. Available fund can be structured with respect to the proneness to forest fire.  \n7. NDRF getting world’s best equipment in near future will be key in forest fire management. \n8. There is need to be an understanding on how to prepare citizens to participate in fire \nmanagement. Priority should be given for large fires. Inclusion of private organisations \nshould also be considered.  \nThe closing remarks of the session was made by Dr. P. K. Mathur. He suggested that the \nformulation of a structured system for forest fire management in the country is a necessity \nconsidering the climate change scenario. The management of forest fires should be developed \nin a way that it must be self-sustainable even after the time period of the national programme. \nHe thanked all the participants on behalf of the Project Drafting Committee. \nThe meeting ended by 5 PM \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nList of participants \nSl. \nNo. \nName \nDesignation \nDepartment/Organization \n1 \nShri Ramesh Kumar Gupta PCCF & HoFF \nForest Department, MP \n2 \nDr. Ajit Kumar \nShrivastava  \nAPCCF & Nodal Officer \n(Forest Fire) \nForest Department, MP \n3 \nShri Kunal Satyarthi \nJoint Secretary (PP \nDivision) \nNDMA \n4 \nDr. P K Mathur \nLead Consultant \nUNDP-NDMA \n5 \nDr. D K Sharma \nLead Consultant \nNDMA \n6 \nShri O.P.

      "In developing countries like India, schools \nare often located in vulnerable areas and \nunprepared to respond to emergencies. In recent \nyears, schools in India have witnessed many \ncatastrophic incidents: a fire led to the deaths of \nover 400 people —about half of them students—\nat a school’s prize giving ceremony in Dabwali \nHaryana in 1995; In 2001 a total of 31 teachers \ndied and 95 were injured; 971 students perished \nand 1,051 were injured in the Bhuj Earthquake, \nGujarat. Formal education was disrupted due to \nwidespread damage to physical infrastructure. \nMany of the buildings collapsed and many \nother were declared unfit for use. Many of these \nbuildings had been poorly constructed, lacked \nearthquake resistant features and were badly \nmaintained. A fire at the Lord Krishna School \nin Kumbakonam, Tamilnadu took the lives of \n94 children in 2004; thousands of students \nand teachers were killed, injured or otherwise \naffected in the 2004 South Asia Tsunami; and 15 \nchildren and 3 teachers died in a boat accident \nduring a school picnic at Kerala in 2007. \nEducation, public awareness and proper training \nfor enhancing the capacity is the cornerstone \nof approaches aimed at reducing vulnerabilities \nto natural hazards. The Hyogo Framework for \nAction 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of \nNations and Communities to Disasters, adopted \nat the World Conference on Disaster Reduction, \nhighlights knowledge and education as one of the \nfive main priorities of action. Attention should be \naccorded and support given to efforts targeting \nschool children and youth with the aim of making \npeople more aware of the threat of hazards and \nof the need and possibility to become better \nprepared before disasters strike.\nTowards this end, Government of India has \napproved a National School Safety Programme \n- a Demonstration Project to be implemented \nby National Disaster Management Authority  \n     To promote a culture of disaster \npreparedness in the school\n• To initiate policy level changes for ensuring\nsafe school environment.\n• To sensitize children and the school \ncommunity on disaster preparedness and \nsafety measures.\n• To motivate direct participation of key \nstakeholders in activities that would \nhelp building towards a disaster resilient \ncommunity.\n• To promote capacity building of officials, \nteachers and students.\n• To carry out Information, Education and \nCommunication (IEC) activities in schools and \nassociated environment.\n• To implement non-structural mitigation \nmeasures in select schools.\n• To carry out demonstrative structural \nretrofitting in select  schools.\nBackground\nVision\nObjective\n(NDMA) in partnership with Ministry of Human \nResource \nDevelopment \n(MHRD) \n, \nState/\nUT Governments, National and International \nAgencies in 43 districts of 22 States /UTs of the \ncountry falling in seismic zone IV & V .",

      "m e s s a g e\n \nIndia has long cultural history of Boat Navigation which dates back \nto 6000 years. It has a wide network of inland waterways. The passenger \nboat accidents are not uncommon in Indian river systems and other \ninland water channels; it was Dhubri ferry tragedy on river Brahmputra \nthat accounted for the loss of over 250 lives. It was then recognized \nthat passenger boat accidents are showing increasing trends in various \ninland waterways leading to loss of life of scores of people.

      "Preface\nIndia has a wide network of Inland Waterways which consists of rivers, backwaters, canals, \nand creeks. Out of the total navigable length of 14500 kms covering various states, around \n5200 kms of rivers and 4000 kms of canals are worthy of proper navigation. India has a long \ncultural history dating back of 6000 years with traditions of boat navigation.\nIn many of the states, transport through rivers and their tributaties is a lifeline of many people. \nBoats, motorized and non motorized, are used to carry people, vehicles, animals and goods. \nHowever, thousands of such boats which ply in the countries Inland Waterways have no \nauthentic checks on the validity/permit and are overaged & also ill designed.\nWhenever any boat accident occurs, the poor training, dangerous working practices, inadequate \nregulations and near non-existent enforcement is pointed as a root cause. The Dhubri ferry \ntragedy of 30th April, 2012 on river Brahmaputra that resulted in loss of over 250 lives, let to \nthe awakening of threat of increased passenger boat accidents in various states. Thus, a need \nfor formulating guidelines on boat and navigable safety in consultation with concerned states \nand stakeholders was felt. NDMA under the provision of the DM Act, 2005 has the mandate to \nissue guidelines for the management of disaster that periodically affects normal life and well \nbeing of the people. Accordingly, NDMA has prepared National Disaster Mangement Guideline \non Boat Safety in consultation with state and other stakeholders. These guidelines will go a \nlong way for safer water navigation. The guidelines addresses all facets of boat safety such \nas weather forecasting & early warning system, safety standards & specifications, regulatory \n& legal issues, search & rescue, capacity development and do’s & don’ts for boat safety has \nbeen elaborated in details.\nWhile NDMA tried to make guidelines extensive, there is surely room for improvement.

      "National Disaster Management Authority\nxix\nIntroduction\nNational Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has been mandated, under the provisions \nof Disaster Management Act 2005 to, inter alia, issue guidelines for the management of \ndisasters that periodically affects normal life and well being of the people.\nAlthough passenger boat accidents are not uncommon in Indian river systems and other \ninland water channels, it was Dhubri ferry tragedy of 30th April, 2012 on river Brahmputra \nthat accounted for the loss of over 250 lives. It was then recognized that passenger boat \naccidents are showing increasing trends in various inland waterways leading to loss of life of \nscores of people. It was also discovered that most of the boat tragedies were on account of \noverloading and various other factors. After consultation with stakeholders, NDMA decided \nto prepare National Guidelines on Boat Safety. The guidelines include action points towards \ndrawing procedures and regulatory elements by states to streamline the passenger boat \nnavigation in the established waterways in the regions.\nIndia has a wide network of inland waterways which consist of rivers, backwaters, canals \nand creeks. Out of the overall navigable length of 14500 km, around 5200 kms of rivers and \n4000 kms of canals are worthy of being used by mechanized vessels for navigation. The North \nEastern region of the country alone is reported to have about 1800 kms of river routes used \nby steamers and large & small country boats. The region has many large rivers and rivulets \nproviding facilities for water transport, especially in its plain parts and in flat river valleys. \nSince long, the rivers of the Brahmputra and Barak plains were commonly used as ‘water-\nways’ for transportation of goods and passengers.\nPassenger boating has been one of the few micro enterprises in the country, where industrial \nintensity and technology modernization could not penetrate in a significant manner. The \nactivities are accomplished with small and large country boats with primitive designs with a \nExecutive Summary",
      "NatioNal Disaster MaNageMeNt guiDeliNes : Boat safety\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nxx\nvery low free-board facility. Passenger boats are considered important means of livelihood \nto many people esp. in the north and north eastern regions. The country boats in these \nwaterways generally carry more number of passengers than technically acceptable and \nreliable from safety considerations. The design of these boats and their engines are mostly \nlocal made or impoverished that rarely acquires certificates before drafting for commercial \noperations. Moreover, these boats are also playing without life jackets\nThe rules of Bengal Ferry Act 1885 do not include safety aspects of the boatmen, operating \nprocedures and mechanisms of boats and boat making etc. The ferry ghat infrastructure \nrequirements have also not been outlined much in the act. There has been an overall \npaucity of instruments of enforcing regulatory control measures over the private boat \noperating services in major water channels. Obviously, such boats do have little safety \narrangements, yet daily passengers have no other means but to adopt this means of \ntransportation.\nObjectives and premises\nThe Guidelines on Boats Safety rest on the following objectives, which aimed at increasing \nthe efficacy of the passenger Boat navigation and its management.\n• \nPassenger boat transport is a state subject.

Since several state governments are \nexperiencing limitations in terms of organizational set up to handle various policy, regulatory \nand operational issues in terms of quality and contents related to safety of inland vessels, \nthe first and foremost requirement would be to develop institutional / organizational set \nup for framing relevant rules and regulations and implementation in an effective manner. \nThis is considered as one of the primary requirements towards navigation safety by boats \nand other inland vessels. It is therefore recommended to create nodal inspectorate by \neach of the concerned states and to bring in SDMA/DDMA into the regulatory role. In the \norganizational set up emphasis must be given to separate the wings for handling matters \nrelated to non-mechanized and mechanized country boats.\nThe Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) needs to be given more representation in regulating \nthe country boats operation in waterways. For this purpose, it is necessary to empower \nPanchayats under specific rules/ regulations. They must also be given specific financial \nand organizational support to institutionalize the enforcement of regulations in boat travel \nmanagement over a period of time.",
      "National Disaster Management Authority\nxxiii\nIt is recommended that a dedicated full fledged department is set up in all the concerned \nstates dealing with inland waterways transportation. It is also proposed that every district \ntransport department / offices should have a cell separated / created specifically for handling \nmatters related to inland vessels. Such officers may in turn train Panchayat officials in handling \nmatters related to mechanized and non-mechanized country boats.",
      "National Disaster Management Authority\n1\n1.1 \nOverview\n1.1.1 \nThe tradition of boat navigation in India has a long cultural history which dates back \nabout 6000 years ago, when the art of navigation was originated from river Sindh \n(Indus). The word “Navigation” is derived from a Sanskrit word “Nav Gatih”. Ancient \nliteratures and scriptures provide several accounts of navigation in river channels and \nsmall waterways. The ‘Rig-Vedic’ period Aryans were well aware about the river and \nsea navigation routes across the country. They were skilled to construct and operate \nboats in a scientific manner.\n1.1.2. \nThe Indian subcontinent is characterized by typical hydro-meteorological set up with \ndense network of rivers system. The country is surrounded on three sides by seas \nwhich are connected with interior drainage network of rivers, thus making enabling \nenvironment for inland waterways for transportation esp. in coastal regions. Many of \nthe coastal states are endowed with natural harbors stretches along 5700 kms long \ncoastlines that act as big commercial transit point in the country.       \n1.1.3. \n In many of the states, where inland water transport through rivers and their tributaries \nis a lifeline for many people, over aged boats ply overcrowded not only with people, \nbut also vehicles, animals and other goods of daily needs. In the aftermath of Dhubri \nferry tragedy in 30th April, 2012 on river Brahmaputra that accounted for a loss of \nover 250 lives, it was recognized that passenger boats accidents are on the increase \nin various states leading to the loss of lives of scores of people .It was also discovered \nthat most of the boat tragedies were on account of overloading and other related \nfactors. There are thousands such boats plying in the country’s inland waterways with \nno authentic checks on the validity/permits. Whenever any boat accident occurs, \nthe reason often points to poor training, dangerous working practices, inadequate \nregulation and near non-existent enforcement as the root causes for this and similar \nlosses of life. Sometimes boat accidents also take place during adventure sports \nBoat Navigation-Status  \n& Context\n1",

Thus a need was felt at the policy level to formulate \nguidelines on boat and navigational safety in consultation with the concerned states \nand stakeholders. The guidelines would be an effort to make enabling reference for \nstates/UTs in streamlining passenger boat navigation in the established waterways \nthrough inception of a set of regulatory and structural framework.\n1.1.4. \nThe prime responsibility of the maintenance of safety in boat transport functionally \nlies with boat operators and wharf (ghat) management authorities; however, the \nadministrative and socio-economic controls are enjoyed by state/district authorities \n.The guidelines is also an effort to sensitize boat operators, passengers, local authorities \nand other stakeholders about the dangers of unsafe navigation practices and potential \ndisaster threats   \n1.2 \nIndian Waterways  – Brief Outline\n1.2.1 \nInland Navigation- There are several waterways in India suitable for inland navigation, \nbut the lower Ganga and the Brahmaputra waterways are specifically suited due to \ntheir distinct advantages like gentle gradient, appropriate depth of water and flow \nthrough densely populated regions. In addition, the tropical nature of climate doesn’t \nallow freezing of water, which provide suitability of navigation throughout the year \nat the cheaper rate .However, due to seasonal nature of rainfall; fluctuation in water \nlevel is greater. Before 1854, there was no railway lines in the entire stretch of the \nGangetic plains, thus goods and passengers had to travel through country boats in \nrivers like the Ganges & the Brahmaputra. The emerging commercial centers during \nthose periods were also preferred to be located near river banks. The cities like Kanpur \nand Patna established due to such suitability. The “Steam Navigation” was introduced \nin 1830, which became very popular particularly in the lower Ganga waterways till \nthe construction of railways was started in 1885 after which the number of country \nboats and cargoes declined gradually in these routes due to the preponderance of rail \ntransportation of goods and passengers which were comparatively safer and faster. \nThus the steam navigation also declined considerably. In addition, the water levels \nin these navigational routes declined considerably after the opening of Lower Ganga \ncanal in 1878 and other canals subsequently. The repeated famines in subsequent \nyears led to the diversion of more waters from these waterways to the water deficit \nregions that led the further decline in water level in these rivers thus greatly affected \nwaterways navigation in these regions.",
      "Boat NavigatioN-StatuS & CoNtext\n3\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n \nThe rapid expansion of railway network and increase in canal irrigation resulted in \nthe decline of cheap river and canal transportation in the waterways of the region. \nThough the Upper and the Lower Ganga canals were built to serve the dual purpose of \nirrigation and navigation, neither of them carries any traffic now. The same condition \nof extinction also occurred in the Sutlej waterways.\n \nEast India is a land of mighty rivers which often damage railway lines and roads during \nthe rainy season. Volumes of consumer goods, fertilizers for tea plantations, and \nmachinery leave Calcutta for Assam by steamers which pass through Bangladesh. \nTwo such inland waterways are between Kolkata and Dhubri as well Kolkata and \nKarimganj. The river Hooghly in West Bengal is an important waterway in east India. \nCargo services also operate regularly between Haldia and Patna. \n \nThe rivers on the Indian Plateau are not suitable for navigation because there is very \nlittle water in the streams during the long dry months. Some distributaries of the \ndeltas of the Krishna, the Godavari and the Mahanadi are navigable. In the middle \nof the last century, irrigation cum-navigation canals were constructed in the deltas \nof the Godavari and Krishna. The canals are particularly suitable means of transport \nhere in view of the difficulty in constructing rail and road bridges on numerous \ndistributaries in the delta regions. These canals now carry a sizable portion of goods \nand passenger traffic. They are inter-connected and, also join the Buckingham Canal \nwhich runs southwards to Chennai and extends for 106 km even beyond Chennai. \nThus, Vijayawada is connected with Chennai by this navigable canal, but fast running \ntrain again has affected adversely the goods and passenger traffic carried by this canal. \nThe Buckingham Canal connects some lagoons and is meant purely for navigation. \nThe coastal lowland of Kerala State is served with navigable canals which also connect \nmany lagoons. The canals are used extensively by country boats for transporting \ngoods like coconut, cashew-nut, pepper and raw rubber. Inland water transport is \nalso important in Goa.\n1.2.2 \nInland Waterways- Economic & Social Context\n \nThe Inland Water Transport (IWT) in India is considered as one of the cost effective, \nrelatively fuel efficient, and environment friendly means of transportation. This also \nprovides livelihoods to many people living along the river courses. India is among \nthose counties where new initiatives are being undertaken to make better use of the \nexisting capacity of Inland waterways transportation. Several development projects \naimed towards the enhancement of inland water transportation infrastructures are",

Out of the total navigable length of about 14500 km, approx 5200 kms. of \nrivers and 4000 kms. of canals are being used by mechanized vessels for navigation. The \nNorth East regions alone subscribe to about 1800 kms of river routes. A large portion \nof it is presently used for transportation of passengers and cargos by mechanized and \nnon-mechanized boats including country boats. It is, therefore needed that social \ncontrol coupled with technology and management support aided by financial and \nregulatory incentives and disincentives may be  promoted that can lead to sizeable \nand competitive expansion of inland water transport and passenger boat industry in \nthe growth Matrix.  \n1.2.3 \nInland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI)\n \nThe  Government of India (GoI) established Inland Waterways Authority of India \n(IWAI) as a statutory body in 1986 entrusted it with the responsibility  to develop, \nmaintain and regulate the  national waterways, and to advise the central and the state \ngovernments on matters relating to the development of inland water transport. IWAI \nis a legal authority in-charge of the waterways in India and was created by the Govt. \nof India on 27 October 1986. Its headquarters is located in Noida, Uttar Pradesh and \nregional offices are at Patna, Kolkata, Guwahati and Kochi and sub-offices at Allahabad, \nVaranasi, Bhagalpur, Farrakka and Kollam. The function of IWAI is to build necessary \ninfrastructure in the waterways, survey the economic possibilities of new projects, \nadministrate, develop and regulate the waterways for navigation and shipping.\n \nMore recently the government has taken a series of decisions  to revitalise the \ninland water transport system to improve its reliability and efficiency and to enable \nit to complement other modes such as road and rail. The government’s new policy \nis to create ‘highways’ on the waterways and to maintain them with private sector \nparticipation and assistance from international aid agencies like the World Bank. \n \nThere has been a policy decision to grant a tax holiday of ten years to this sector, and \nto  encourage private Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs)  to bring in modern technology \nto upgrade the indigenous capabilities. Another important policy initiative taken is \nto involve more actively, the concerned state governments in the development of \ninland water transport. Techno-Economic studies have been conducted on many new \nwaterways such as the Godavari, Krishna, Buckingham Canal System from Kakinada to \nMarcanum, the Sunderbans, Goa rivers, Brahmani & East Coast Canal from Talcher to \nParadip & Haldia, the DVC Canal, Barak river etc. which have potential for immediate \ndevelopment.",
      "Boat NavigatioN-StatuS & CoNtext\n5\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n \nIt is estimated that the north-eastern region has about 1800 km of river routes \nthat can be used by steamers and large country boats. The inland water transport \ndepartments of both the state and central governments have been trying to improve \nthe water transport system in the region. The river Brahmaputra now has several \nsmall river-ports like Sadiya, Dibrugarh, Neamati, Tezpur, Guwahati, Jogighopa and \nDhubri. Besides, there are more than thirty pairs of ferry-ghats on the Brahmaputra, \ntransporting men and materials. The River Barak also has small ports at Karimganj, \nBadarpur and Silchar and ferry services at several places across it. The major tributaries \nof Brahmaputra namely Lohit, Dhansiri and Subansiri, rivers of Tripura namely Gumti \nand Haora, Tizu river in Nagaland, Kolodyne river in Mizoram are having immense \nnavigation potential and it can be developed for better utilization of both cargo and \npassenger movements.\n1.2.4 \nNational Waterways in India\n \nThere are total five national waterways in India; which provide means of public and \nfreight transportation. Cargo transportation is only limited to a few waterways in Goa, \nWest Bengal, Assam and Kerala in an organized manner\n \nThe concept of National Waterways was introduced in 1982 to promote the \ndevelopment of inland water transport in the country. Following 5 (five) waterways \nwere declared National waterways by separate acts of parliament.\n \n1. \nNational Waterway 1 - This important waterway covers the length of 1620 kms. \ntretching from Allahabad to Haldia in the Ganges–Bhagirathi–Hooghly river \nsystem.

It is observed that the safety of the boatman, operating conditions \nof boats and boat making docks, inconsistent or nonexistent ferry ghat infrastructures \nhave not been outlined much in the rules and ferry acts available. \n \nThere is an overall paucity of control measures over the private boat operating \nservices in major water channels. Such boats do have little safety measures, yet daily \npassengers have no other means than to travel in such dangerous conditions.\n \nThe following prime factors contribute to boat/ferry accidents in most of the inland \nwaterways -\n \n• \nUnderstaffing/Unqualified crew\n \n• \nSevere overcrowding\n \n• \nAgeing vessels \n \n• \nLack of regulatory standards\n \n• \nFaulty boat design and stability",

      "National Disaster Management Authority\n17\n3.1. \nOverview\nThe importance of ‘safety’ in the passenger-boat travel and its long term benefits cannot \nbe underestimated. Design of boats to meet the safety specifications and to   conform to \noperational standards would form the    first and the foremost desirable structural support to \n‘mitigation and management of risks’ in the boat travel. The second and the equally important \nsupport structure for safe boats operation is the “Wharf Facility” which can be accomplished \nwith their modernization and advanced embankment arrangements in the form of floating Jetty-\ninfrastructure, and related support systems. The enforcement of adopting the standard designs \nand operating regimes of boat navigation requires active cooperation from boat manufacturers \nand operators, whereas the responsibility of ensuring availability of boats, modernization of \nwharfs with suitable embankments rest with the state governments. However, the successful \nimplementation and enforcement of safety standards is largely dependent on the proactive \nrole to be played by local administration including Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs), State and \nDistrict Disaster Management Authorities and other local level functionaries. \n3.2. \nBoat Design, Trends and Practices\n3.2 .1 \nMost of the passenger boats or country crafts are constructed in a primitive or \ntraditional style by using locally available material especially woods. The traditional \nboat construction styles are carried forward from one generation to the next \ngeneration thereby having less scope of modernization. Some of the boats are, \nhowever, mechanized using agricultural pumps, engine and propeller systems. \nHowever, most of the boats do not have gear boxes for reduction of speeds or for \nproviding mechanism for reversing. In addition, many of the boat-designs have low \nfree board which is unsafe for carrying passengers. \nSafety Standards &  \nSpecifications\n3",

It is, therefore, recommended that all new boats should be \ndesigned & constructed as per the recognized standards and construction rules of \nthe certification body. \n \nIn case of existing boats, it should be demonstrated by the history of safe operation \nof the boat or similar design of boats that the construction of the vessels is adequate \nfor the service.\n3.3.2. \nFreeboard and Stability\n \nFreeboard is defined as the minimum vertical distance from the waterline to the top \nof deck at side in case of a decked boat or to the top of side in an open boat.  This \ncorresponds with the full load condition and gives a good measure of the safety of \nthe boat. The freeboard values are assigned by certifying authority ‘Indian Register \nof Shipping’ according to the applicable rules. The Freeboard values increase with \nthe length of the boat. When freeboard is not assigned, the following values may be \nrecommended-\nTypes of Boat\nBoat Length\nFreeboard\nDecked Boats\nUp to 7 meters\n120 mm\n18 meters & above\n240 mm\nOpen Boats\nUp to 7 meters\n240 mm\n18 meters & above\n480 mm\n\t\nTable\t–\tFreeboard\tvalues\tfor\tdifferent\tboat\tlength\t\n \nFor Intermediate length in both the cases, freeboard values may be interpolated. The \nStability of a boat is checked by the certification body (Indian Register of Shipping). \nIn case of boats, which already exist, the certifying body may use a heeling test to \nverify the stability of boats for carrying the specified number of passengers. \n3.3.3. \nRegistration Number and Seating Capacity on Board\n \nIt may be a good practice to keep mandatory provisions for boats to have registration \nwith the local statutory body such as Inland Water Transport Department of the \nconcerned State. The Registration number should be prominently marked on the \nboat on a particular place as decided by the authority.",
      "Safety StandardS & SpecificationS\n19\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n \nSince overloading is one of the common reasons of boat accidents, it is necessary to \ndetermine the maximum number of persons that can be safely carried on each boat \nand clearly marked on the boat. The carrying capacity of the boat should be primarily \ndetermined by stability and space considerations. The floor space required may be \nbased on 1.8 square meter per person. In case of long seats or benches, two persons \nmay be accommodated per meter of the seat.\n3.3.4 \nMonitoring and Maintenance\n \nThe statutory body responsible for regulating boat operations should frame out rules \nand regulations for monitoring and periodical examination of boats. The operators \nshould have to satisfy themselves about the integrity of the vessel’s hull by an out \nof water examination at least every 3 years and 2 years in case of wooden vessels, \nwhich  should be documented.  In addition, the external components of steering and \npropulsion machinery and shell fittings should also be examined out of the water.  \nThe documented report of such examination should be made available on board for \nverification by statutory bodies, passengers associations, local NGOs, interested users \netc.\n3.3.5 \nSafety Briefings \n \nAt the start of every voyage or trip, the master operator or other responsible crew \nmembers should give safety briefing to passengers. The safety briefing should consist \nof restrictions about the movement on board, emergency procedures, location of \nemergency exits, stowage and use of personal protective equipments such as life \njackets and life buoys.\n3.3.6. \nWharfs/ Jetties\n \nThe availability of proper infrastructures at each wharf/Jetty for embarkation and \ndisembarkation are equally important for safe boating. It should be the responsibility \nof local authorities to provide adequate facilities. Wherever any variation in water level \nexists in rivers or harbors, the appropriate stairways and landings should be provided \ncovering the whole range of water levels for safe embarkation/disembarkation. The \nfloating facilities may also be used for embarkation/ disembarkation.  Suitable barges \nfor landing should be arranged with gangways/ ladders connected to shore for this \npurpose.

It has a wide network of inland waterways. The passenger \nboat accidents are not uncommon in Indian river systems and other \ninland water channels; it was Dhubri ferry tragedy on river Brahmputra \nthat accounted for the loss of over 250 lives. It was then recognized \nthat passenger boat accidents are showing increasing trends in various \ninland waterways leading to loss of life of scores of people. It emerges \nfrom analysis of boat accients data that most tragedies are on account \nof overloading and poor maintenance of boats.\n\t\nTill\tvery\trecently,\tIndia\thad\tonly\tfive\tNational\tWaterways\tcreated\tby\t\nActs of Parliament.

Total of 111 Waterways have been declared \nas National Waterways making safety of boat navigation a must.\n \nI congratulate NDMA for bringing out Guidelines on Boat Safety \nwhich would go a long way in assuring safe navigation. I urge all the \nstakeholders and State Governments to work together for better and \nsafe boat navigation\n(Kiren Rijiju)\n20th September, 2017\nNew Delhi.\n\nPreface\nIndia has a wide network of Inland Waterways which consists of rivers, backwaters, canals, \nand creeks. Out of the total navigable length of 14500 kms covering various states, around \n5200 kms of rivers and 4000 kms of canals are worthy of proper navigation. India has a long \ncultural history dating back of 6000 years with traditions of boat navigation.\nIn many of the states, transport through rivers and their tributaties is a lifeline of many people. \nBoats, motorized and non motorized, are used to carry people, vehicles, animals and goods. \nHowever, thousands of such boats which ply in the countries Inland Waterways have no \nauthentic checks on the validity/permit and are overaged & also ill designed.\nWhenever any boat accident occurs, the poor training, dangerous working practices, inadequate \nregulations and near non-existent enforcement is pointed as a root cause. The Dhubri ferry \ntragedy of 30th April, 2012 on river Brahmaputra that resulted in loss of over 250 lives, let to \nthe awakening of threat of increased passenger boat accidents in various states. Thus, a need \nfor formulating guidelines on boat and navigable safety in consultation with concerned states \nand stakeholders was felt. NDMA under the provision of the DM Act, 2005 has the mandate to \nissue guidelines for the management of disaster that periodically affects normal life and well \nbeing of the people. Accordingly, NDMA has prepared National Disaster Mangement Guideline \non Boat Safety in consultation with state and other stakeholders. These guidelines will go a \nlong way for safer water navigation. The guidelines addresses all facets of boat safety such \nas weather forecasting & early warning system, safety standards & specifications, regulatory \n& legal issues, search & rescue, capacity development and do’s & don’ts for boat safety has \nbeen elaborated in details.\nWhile NDMA tried to make guidelines extensive, there is surely room for improvement.

The National and State level institution and \nindividuals who have provided inputs to the preparation of this document the numerous such as CWC, \nIMD, IRS, IWAI, NDRF, NIDM, Ports of Goa and several state government authorities etc. We gratefully \nacknowledge all of their support and encouragement.\nShri A.K. Sanghi, Joint Secretary, Head of Mitigation Division worked assiduously and led the finalization \nof National Guidelines on Boat Safety. He was ably supported by Shri Pushkar Sahay, Joint Advisor, \nNDMA who coordinated activities associated with preparation of guidelines. Valuable expert technical \nassistance was provided by Shri Shankar Mahto, Sr. Consultant (Food & River Erosion) who also analysed \nthe inputs received from a range of institutions and stakeholders and incorporated in the guidelines. \nWe also acknowledge the contribution of staff of Mitigation Division in preparation of the guidelines.\nFinalization of the first National Disaster Mangement Guidelines on Boat Safety is the culmination \nof the long process. During this period several round of consultation were held, inputs sought even \nfrom general public and draft prepared. We would like to greatly acknowledge the contribution of the \nchairman of the working groups which formed to prepare the initial draft. The former Sr. Consultant \n(F&RE), Dr. Rajnish Ranjan and Shri V. Venkatesan, Former Consultant (Cyclone) also played a critical \nrole in drafting the guidelines. These inputs have proved to be bedrock on which the current guidelines \nstands.\nIn summary, the preparation of the National Disaster Mangement Guidelines on Boat Safety exemplifies \nteam work that spans across different institutions and the academia. This sets the tone that will be \nrequired for its effective implementation.\nAcknowledgements\n\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nxv\nExecutive Summary \nxix-xxiii\n1 \nBoat Navigation-Status & Context \n1\n \n1.1 Overview \n1\n \n1.2 Indian Waterways  – Brief Outline \n2\n \n1.3 Background of Boat Accidents \n6\n \n1.4 Role of State, Organization and System \n8\n2 \nWeather Forecasting & Early Warning System \n11\n \n2.1 Overview \n11\n \n2.2 Weather Forecasting for Safe Boat Operations \n11\n \n2.3 Implementation Programme-Roles and Responsibilities of various agencies 15\n3. \nSafety Standards & Specifications \n17\n \n3.1 Overview \n17\n \n3.2 Boat Design, Trends and Practices \n17\n \n3.3.

It was then recognized that passenger boat \naccidents are showing increasing trends in various inland waterways leading to loss of life of \nscores of people. It was also discovered that most of the boat tragedies were on account of \noverloading and various other factors. After consultation with stakeholders, NDMA decided \nto prepare National Guidelines on Boat Safety. The guidelines include action points towards \ndrawing procedures and regulatory elements by states to streamline the passenger boat \nnavigation in the established waterways in the regions.\nIndia has a wide network of inland waterways which consist of rivers, backwaters, canals \nand creeks. Out of the overall navigable length of 14500 km, around 5200 kms of rivers and \n4000 kms of canals are worthy of being used by mechanized vessels for navigation. The North \nEastern region of the country alone is reported to have about 1800 kms of river routes used \nby steamers and large & small country boats. The region has many large rivers and rivulets \nproviding facilities for water transport, especially in its plain parts and in flat river valleys. \nSince long, the rivers of the Brahmputra and Barak plains were commonly used as ‘water-\nways’ for transportation of goods and passengers.\nPassenger boating has been one of the few micro enterprises in the country, where industrial \nintensity and technology modernization could not penetrate in a significant manner. The \nactivities are accomplished with small and large country boats with primitive designs with a \nExecutive Summary\n\nNatioNal Disaster MaNageMeNt guiDeliNes : Boat safety\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nxx\nvery low free-board facility. Passenger boats are considered important means of livelihood \nto many people esp. in the north and north eastern regions. The country boats in these \nwaterways generally carry more number of passengers than technically acceptable and \nreliable from safety considerations. The design of these boats and their engines are mostly \nlocal made or impoverished that rarely acquires certificates before drafting for commercial \noperations. Moreover, these boats are also playing without life jackets\nThe rules of Bengal Ferry Act 1885 do not include safety aspects of the boatmen, operating \nprocedures and mechanisms of boats and boat making etc. The ferry ghat infrastructure \nrequirements have also not been outlined much in the act. There has been an overall \npaucity of instruments of enforcing regulatory control measures over the private boat \noperating services in major water channels. Obviously, such boats do have little safety \narrangements, yet daily passengers have no other means but to adopt this means of \ntransportation.\nObjectives and premises\nThe Guidelines on Boats Safety rest on the following objectives, which aimed at increasing \nthe efficacy of the passenger Boat navigation and its management.\n• \nPassenger boat transport is a state subject. Regulations and operating procedures \nwould have to be prepared by states. The guidelines will facilitate the same.\n• \nSince Passenger boat transport is a dispersed activity, states are required to encourage, \nin the first place, the implementation and enforcement of applicable provision of \nconventions/regulations, including the application/ implementation of ‘The Bengal \nFerry act (1885)’, with modifications as felt appropriate, with a view to ensure \nharmonization of ferrying legislation within the country.\n• \nAny future legislation be user-friendly, easily understandable, enforceable, acceptable \nto many and must include appropriate penalties severe enough to encourage effective \nimplementation and discourage violation.\n• \nRegulations be made by states subject to periodic review based on surveying, training \nand bringing in uniformity and to meet standards set by all the states dealing with \nriverine water transport.\n• \nRegulations must encourage stakeholders to develop/establish safety management \nsystem for domestic ferries and passengervessels that include, but are not limited to, \n\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nxxi\nkey elements such as-\n \na. Training in operational matters, including planned maintenance;\n \nb. Safety awareness programmes and pre-departure safety briefs for passengers;\n \nc.  Effective communication between master, surveyors and boat owners to facilitate \nproper boat inspections and surveys; and\n \nd.  Stability guidance information, including availability of stability books to \nmasters.\n• \nSharing of best practices and resources across all stakeholders and through regional \nassociations;\n• \nEncourage development of national and regional search and rescue (SAR) response \nand communication plans and mock drills. \nApproaches\nAverting a disaster or response to mitigate the severity of disaster, as it relates to passenger \nboat accidents during navigation, require (i) prior and adequate advance knowledge of likely \nincidents; (ii) availability of instruments/facilities to contain the risks; (iii) arrangements/ \ntools to facilitate quick resurrection; and above all (iv) facility of skilled manpower support \nto organize the pre and post event response mechanisms.\nThus the guidelines are presented in five related segments as below:\n• \nWater Forecasting & Early Warning System- This is dealt in the second chapter wherein \nthe spatial and temporal variations in climate characteristics and the resultant impacts \nare discussed. It is essential that boat owners and waterways management authorities \nmust pay attention on weather bulletins and guidelines issued by local meteorological \norganizations to avert boat tragedies.\n• \nSafety Standards & Specifications – These aspects have been discussed in chapter \n3 wherein the importance of safety measures are discussed in details. The general \nsafety measures expected to be adopted by boat operators are dealt with in this \nchapter. In addition, safety standards for mechanized and non mechanized boats are \nalso discussed.\n• \nRegulatory & Legal Issues- This is discussed in chapter 4. The regulatory provisions \nof national waterways, the existing ferry acts and rules and other legal issues are \n\nNatioNal Disaster MaNageMeNt guiDeliNes : Boat safety\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nxxii\ndiscussed in this chapter. The model rules are discussed in this chapter with roles and \nresponsibilities of the proposed Inspectorate of Safety.\n• \nSearch and Rescue – The Search and Rescue operations in the aftermath of boat \naccidents are equally important as the mitigation measures. The chapter 5 discusses \nthese issues in details in reference to boat and navigation safety. Some of the \nimportant aspects like Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), Accident Management \nPlan, Emergency Search and Rescue, Response mechanisms at boats/vessels, rescue \nelements at ghats, medical action plans etc. are discussed in this chapter.\n• \nCapacity Development- The Capacity Development aims to create enabling environment \nwith appropriate policy and legal framework, institutional development including \ncommunity participation through which individuals, organizations and societies obtain, \nstrengthen and maintain capabilities to set and achieve their own development \nobjectives over time. Chapter 6 discusses in details about the role of capacity \ndevelopment on safe boat operations in navigable waterways.\nInstitutional framework\nThe responsibility of the implementation of rules and regulations related to safety of inland \nvessels primarily rests with the state governments. Since several state governments are \nexperiencing limitations in terms of organizational set up to handle various policy, regulatory \nand operational issues in terms of quality and contents related to safety of inland vessels, \nthe first and foremost requirement would be to develop institutional / organizational set \nup for framing relevant rules and regulations and implementation in an effective manner. \nThis is considered as one of the primary requirements towards navigation safety by boats \nand other inland vessels. It is therefore recommended to create nodal inspectorate by \neach of the concerned states and to bring in SDMA/DDMA into the regulatory role. In the \norganizational set up emphasis must be given to separate the wings for handling matters \nrelated to non-mechanized and mechanized country boats.\nThe Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) needs to be given more representation in regulating \nthe country boats operation in waterways. For this purpose, it is necessary to empower \nPanchayats under specific rules/ regulations. They must also be given specific financial \nand organizational support to institutionalize the enforcement of regulations in boat travel \nmanagement over a period of time.\n\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nxxiii\nIt is recommended that a dedicated full fledged department is set up in all the concerned \nstates dealing with inland waterways transportation. It is also proposed that every district \ntransport department / offices should have a cell separated / created specifically for handling \nmatters related to inland vessels. Such officers may in turn train Panchayat officials in handling \nmatters related to mechanized and non-mechanized country boats.\n\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n1\n1.1 \nOverview\n1.1.1 \nThe tradition of boat navigation in India has a long cultural history which dates back \nabout 6000 years ago, when the art of navigation was originated from river Sindh \n(Indus). The word “Navigation” is derived from a Sanskrit word “Nav Gatih”. Ancient \nliteratures and scriptures provide several accounts of navigation in river channels and \nsmall waterways. The ‘Rig-Vedic’ period Aryans were well aware about the river and \nsea navigation routes across the country. They were skilled to construct and operate \nboats in a scientific manner.\n1.1.2. \nThe Indian subcontinent is characterized by typical hydro-meteorological set up with \ndense network of rivers system. The country is surrounded on three sides by seas \nwhich are connected with interior drainage network of rivers, thus making enabling \nenvironment for inland waterways for transportation esp. in coastal regions. Many of \nthe coastal states are endowed with natural harbors stretches along 5700 kms long \ncoastlines that act as big commercial transit point in the country.       \n1.1.3. \n In many of the states, where inland water transport through rivers and their tributaries \nis a lifeline for many people, over aged boats ply overcrowded not only with people, \nbut also vehicles, animals and other goods of daily needs. In the aftermath of Dhubri \nferry tragedy in 30th April, 2012 on river Brahmaputra that accounted for a loss of \nover 250 lives, it was recognized that passenger boats accidents are on the increase \nin various states leading to the loss of lives of scores of people .It was also discovered \nthat most of the boat tragedies were on account of overloading and other related \nfactors. There are thousands such boats plying in the country’s inland waterways with \nno authentic checks on the validity/permits. Whenever any boat accident occurs, \nthe reason often points to poor training, dangerous working practices, inadequate \nregulation and near non-existent enforcement as the root causes for this and similar \nlosses of life. Sometimes boat accidents also take place during adventure sports \nBoat Navigation-Status  \n& Context\n1\n\nNatioNal Disaster MaNageMeNt guiDeliNes : Boat safety\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n2\nboating and that’s too in turbulent water that is considered a purely man made risk. \nThis may also cause boat mishaps. Thus a need was felt at the policy level to formulate \nguidelines on boat and navigational safety in consultation with the concerned states \nand stakeholders. The guidelines would be an effort to make enabling reference for \nstates/UTs in streamlining passenger boat navigation in the established waterways \nthrough inception of a set of regulatory and structural framework.\n1.1.4. \nThe prime responsibility of the maintenance of safety in boat transport functionally \nlies with boat operators and wharf (ghat) management authorities; however, the \nadministrative and socio-economic controls are enjoyed by state/district authorities \n.The guidelines is also an effort to sensitize boat operators, passengers, local authorities \nand other stakeholders about the dangers of unsafe navigation practices and potential \ndisaster threats   \n1.2 \nIndian Waterways  – Brief Outline\n1.2.1 \nInland Navigation- There are several waterways in India suitable for inland navigation, \nbut the lower Ganga and the Brahmaputra waterways are specifically suited due to \ntheir distinct advantages like gentle gradient, appropriate depth of water and flow \nthrough densely populated regions. In addition, the tropical nature of climate doesn’t \nallow freezing of water, which provide suitability of navigation throughout the year \nat the cheaper rate .However, due to seasonal nature of rainfall; fluctuation in water \nlevel is greater. Before 1854, there was no railway lines in the entire stretch of the \nGangetic plains, thus goods and passengers had to travel through country boats in \nrivers like the Ganges & the Brahmaputra. The emerging commercial centers during \nthose periods were also preferred to be located near river banks. The cities like Kanpur \nand Patna established due to such suitability. The “Steam Navigation” was introduced \nin 1830, which became very popular particularly in the lower Ganga waterways till \nthe construction of railways was started in 1885 after which the number of country \nboats and cargoes declined gradually in these routes due to the preponderance of rail \ntransportation of goods and passengers which were comparatively safer and faster. \nThus the steam navigation also declined considerably. In addition, the water levels \nin these navigational routes declined considerably after the opening of Lower Ganga \ncanal in 1878 and other canals subsequently. The repeated famines in subsequent \nyears led to the diversion of more waters from these waterways to the water deficit \nregions that led the further decline in water level in these rivers thus greatly affected \nwaterways navigation in these regions.    \n\nBoat NavigatioN-StatuS & CoNtext\n3\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n \nThe rapid expansion of railway network and increase in canal irrigation resulted in \nthe decline of cheap river and canal transportation in the waterways of the region. \nThough the Upper and the Lower Ganga canals were built to serve the dual purpose of \nirrigation and navigation, neither of them carries any traffic now. The same condition \nof extinction also occurred in the Sutlej waterways.\n \nEast India is a land of mighty rivers which often damage railway lines and roads during \nthe rainy season. Volumes of consumer goods, fertilizers for tea plantations, and \nmachinery leave Calcutta for Assam by steamers which pass through Bangladesh. \nTwo such inland waterways are between Kolkata and Dhubri as well Kolkata and \nKarimganj. The river Hooghly in West Bengal is an important waterway in east India. \nCargo services also operate regularly between Haldia and Patna. \n \nThe rivers on the Indian Plateau are not suitable for navigation because there is very \nlittle water in the streams during the long dry months. Some distributaries of the \ndeltas of the Krishna, the Godavari and the Mahanadi are navigable. In the middle \nof the last century, irrigation cum-navigation canals were constructed in the deltas \nof the Godavari and Krishna. The canals are particularly suitable means of transport \nhere in view of the difficulty in constructing rail and road bridges on numerous \ndistributaries in the delta regions. These canals now carry a sizable portion of goods \nand passenger traffic. They are inter-connected and, also join the Buckingham Canal \nwhich runs southwards to Chennai and extends for 106 km even beyond Chennai. \nThus, Vijayawada is connected with Chennai by this navigable canal, but fast running \ntrain again has affected adversely the goods and passenger traffic carried by this canal. \nThe Buckingham Canal connects some lagoons and is meant purely for navigation. \nThe coastal lowland of Kerala State is served with navigable canals which also connect \nmany lagoons. The canals are used extensively by country boats for transporting \ngoods like coconut, cashew-nut, pepper and raw rubber. Inland water transport is \nalso important in Goa.\n1.2.2 \nInland Waterways- Economic & Social Context\n \nThe Inland Water Transport (IWT) in India is considered as one of the cost effective, \nrelatively fuel efficient, and environment friendly means of transportation. This also \nprovides livelihoods to many people living along the river courses. India is among \nthose counties where new initiatives are being undertaken to make better use of the \nexisting capacity of Inland waterways transportation. Several development projects \naimed towards the enhancement of inland water transportation infrastructures are \n\n4\nNatioNal Disaster MaNageMeNt guiDeliNes : Boat safety\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nunderway. Out of the total navigable length of about 14500 km, approx 5200 kms. of \nrivers and 4000 kms. of canals are being used by mechanized vessels for navigation. The \nNorth East regions alone subscribe to about 1800 kms of river routes. A large portion \nof it is presently used for transportation of passengers and cargos by mechanized and \nnon-mechanized boats including country boats. It is, therefore needed that social \ncontrol coupled with technology and management support aided by financial and \nregulatory incentives and disincentives may be  promoted that can lead to sizeable \nand competitive expansion of inland water transport and passenger boat industry in \nthe growth Matrix.  \n1.2.3 \nInland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI)\n \nThe  Government of India (GoI) established Inland Waterways Authority of India \n(IWAI) as a statutory body in 1986 entrusted it with the responsibility  to develop, \nmaintain and regulate the  national waterways, and to advise the central and the state \ngovernments on matters relating to the development of inland water transport. IWAI \nis a legal authority in-charge of the waterways in India and was created by the Govt. \nof India on 27 October 1986. Its headquarters is located in Noida, Uttar Pradesh and \nregional offices are at Patna, Kolkata, Guwahati and Kochi and sub-offices at Allahabad, \nVaranasi, Bhagalpur, Farrakka and Kollam. The function of IWAI is to build necessary \ninfrastructure in the waterways, survey the economic possibilities of new projects, \nadministrate, develop and regulate the waterways for navigation and shipping.\n \nMore recently the government has taken a series of decisions  to revitalise the \ninland water transport system to improve its reliability and efficiency and to enable \nit to complement other modes such as road and rail. The government’s new policy \nis to create ‘highways’ on the waterways and to maintain them with private sector \nparticipation and assistance from international aid agencies like the World Bank. \n \nThere has been a policy decision to grant a tax holiday of ten years to this sector, and \nto  encourage private Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs)  to bring in modern technology \nto upgrade the indigenous capabilities. Another important policy initiative taken is \nto involve more actively, the concerned state governments in the development of \ninland water transport. Techno-Economic studies have been conducted on many new \nwaterways such as the Godavari, Krishna, Buckingham Canal System from Kakinada to \nMarcanum, the Sunderbans, Goa rivers, Brahmani & East Coast Canal from Talcher to \nParadip & Haldia, the DVC Canal, Barak river etc. which have potential for immediate \ndevelopment.\n\nBoat NavigatioN-StatuS & CoNtext\n5\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n \nIt is estimated that the north-eastern region has about 1800 km of river routes \nthat can be used by steamers and large country boats. The inland water transport \ndepartments of both the state and central governments have been trying to improve \nthe water transport system in the region. The river Brahmaputra now has several \nsmall river-ports like Sadiya, Dibrugarh, Neamati, Tezpur, Guwahati, Jogighopa and \nDhubri. Besides, there are more than thirty pairs of ferry-ghats on the Brahmaputra, \ntransporting men and materials. The River Barak also has small ports at Karimganj, \nBadarpur and Silchar and ferry services at several places across it. The major tributaries \nof Brahmaputra namely Lohit, Dhansiri and Subansiri, rivers of Tripura namely Gumti \nand Haora, Tizu river in Nagaland, Kolodyne river in Mizoram are having immense \nnavigation potential and it can be developed for better utilization of both cargo and \npassenger movements.\n1.2.4 \nNational Waterways in India\n \nThere are total five national waterways in India; which provide means of public and \nfreight transportation. Cargo transportation is only limited to a few waterways in Goa, \nWest Bengal, Assam and Kerala in an organized manner\n \nThe concept of National Waterways was introduced in 1982 to promote the \ndevelopment of inland water transport in the country. Following 5 (five) waterways \nwere declared National waterways by separate acts of parliament.\n \n1. \nNational Waterway 1 - This important waterway covers the length of 1620 kms. \ntretching from Allahabad to Haldia in the Ganges–Bhagirathi–Hooghly river \nsystem. This was established in October, 1986. It has fixed terminals at Haldia, \nBISN (Kolkata), Pakur, Farrakka & Patna and floating terminals at Haldia, Kolkata, \nDiamond Harbour, Katwa , Tribeni , Baharampur, Jangipur, Bhagalpur, Semaria, \nDoriganj, Ballia, Ghazipur, Varanasi, Chunar and Allahabad.\n \n2. \nNational Waterway 2 running from Sadiya to Dhubri stretch of river Brahmaputra \nhaving the total length of 891 kms. This was established in September, 1988. \nThe Pandu is having fixed terminal facility whereas Dhubri, Jogighopa, Tezpur, \nSilghat, Dibrugarh, Jamgurhi, Bogibil, Saikhowa  and Sadiya are floating terminals.\n \n3. \nNational Waterway 3 lies on the Kottapuram-Kollam stretch of the West Coast \nCanal, Champakara Canal and Udyogmandal Canal. It was established in February \n1993. The total length of the route is 205 km. Thrikkunnapuzha, Kollam and \nAlappuzha are fixed terminals on this waterway. \n\n6\nNatioNal Disaster MaNageMeNt guiDeliNes : Boat safety\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n \n4. \nNational Waterway 4 lies on the Kakinada-Pondicherry (1027 Km) stretch of \nCanals and the  Kaluvelly Tank, Bhadrachalam-Rajahmundry stretch of River \nGodavari and Wazirabad-Vijayawada stretch of River Krishna, It was established \nin November. \n \n5. \nNational Waterway 5 lies on the Talcher- Dhamra stretch of the Brahmani \nRiver, the Geonkhali- Charbatia stretch of the East Coast Canal (588 kms), the \nCharbatia-Dhamra stretch of Matai River and the Mangalgadi-Paradip stretch \nof the Mahanadi River Delta. It was established in November 2008.\n \n6. \nNational Waterway Act, 2016 (No17 of 2016) was passed in both houses of \nparliament and published in Gazette of India on 26.03.2016. 111 National \nWaterways have been declared as National waterways including the existing \nfive National Waterways. \n1.3 \nBackground of Boat Accidents \n \nIn many of the navigable waterways in India, boats usually run without life jackets \nor inflated tubes and engines - mostly local made or impoverished versions, are not \nchecked for fitness. It is observed that the safety of the boatman, operating conditions \nof boats and boat making docks, inconsistent or nonexistent ferry ghat infrastructures \nhave not been outlined much in the rules and ferry acts available. \n \nThere is an overall paucity of control measures over the private boat operating \nservices in major water channels. Such boats do have little safety measures, yet daily \npassengers have no other means than to travel in such dangerous conditions.\n \nThe following prime factors contribute to boat/ferry accidents in most of the inland \nwaterways -\n \n• \nUnderstaffing/Unqualified crew\n \n• \nSevere overcrowding\n \n• \nAgeing vessels \n \n• \nLack of regulatory standards\n \n• \nFaulty boat design and stability\n\nBoat NavigatioN-StatuS & CoNtext\n7\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n•\t\nOPERATORS\tDISTRACTION\t\n \nThe person operating the boat or personal watercraft divert attention to other issues \nwhile driving boats may cause accidents\n•\t\nRECKLESS\tOPERATION\tOF\tTHE\tBOAT\t\n \nMany a times, boats accidents occur due to over speeding of boats or watercrafts. In \naddition negligence in boat operations also cause accidents.\n•\t\nUNRULY\tOR\tRAMPANT\tPASSENGERS\t\t\n \nSometimes unruly passengers in boats/ferries create ruckus or chaos on board, and \nmay slips and hits their head, falls overboard, etc. This also cause accidents due to \nimbalance.\n•\t\nRECKLESS\tSKIERS\t\n \nReckless skiers performing illegal or dangerous stunts around boats may cause \nimbalance of boats or distraction by boat operator that may cause accidents.\n•\t\nDRIVING\tUNDER\tTHE\tINFLUENCE\tOF\tALCOHOL\n \nWhen a person has been drinking they are far more likely to fall overboard and \ndrown. Alcohol also leads to a lack of judgment which results in many of the other \nfactors listed here as contributing to boat accidents. Person may be injured because \nof someone else’s operating their boat or watercraft under the influence of alcohol.\n•\t\nFAILURE\tTO\tPOST\tA\tPROPER\tLOOKOUT\t\n \nMany boating accidents, especially collisions occur because no one is watching for \nobstacles, other boats, etc. \n•\t\nINEXPERIENCED\tOPERATOR\t\n \nJust as car accidents are more common among new drivers, anyone who is new to \noperating a boat or a personal watercraft is at higher risk for causing or being involved \nin a boating accident.\n•\t\nEQUIPMENT\tFAILURE\n \nBoat accident may also be caused due to the failure of equipments on board of boats \nor personal watercrafts.\n\n8\nNatioNal Disaster MaNageMeNt guiDeliNes : Boat safety\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n•\t\nPOOR\tWEATHER\tCONDITIONS\t\n \nThis is a major contributor to many serious boating accidents, especially accidents that \ninvolve the loss of the vessel. It is important to pay attention to weather advisories \nso that you are not caught in conditions that your vessel was not designed to handle.\n1.4 \nRole of State, Organization and System\n \nWhile recognizing the importance of boat and navigational safety along waterways, it \nis required to invite attentions of stakeholders like state governments, boat owners/\noperators, training providers, boat industry associations etc. to take precautionary \nmeasures and actions as follows: \n \n1. \nImplementation and enforcement of applicable provisions of conventions/\nregulations, with a view to ensure harmonization of ferrying legislation within \nthe country. \n \n2. \nTo ensure that legislation is user-friendly, easily understood, enforceable, \naccessible to all and includes appropriate penalties severe enough to encourage \neffective implementation. \n \n3. \nPeriodic review and updation of the relevant provisions of guidelines. \n \n4. \nDevelopment and implementation of the effective passenger control and \naccountability mechanisms. \n \n5. \nEncourage stakeholders to develop safety management systems for domestic \nferries and passenger vessels that include, but are not limited to, key elements \nsuch as: \n \na. \nTraining in operational matters, including planned maintenance. \n \nb. \nSafety awareness programmes and pre-departure safety briefs for \npassengers.\n \nc. \nClear communication and the provision of necessary information, including \nweather forecasts, to support boat masters. \n \nd. \nEffective communication between masters, surveyors and boat owners \nto facilitate proper boat inspections and surveys. \n \ne. \nStability guidance information, including availability of stability books to \nmasters.\n\nBoat NavigatioN-StatuS & CoNtext\n9\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n \n6. \nIncentives and subsidies for procurements of new boat/vessels.\n \n7. \nEncourage the development of adequate infrastructure, particularly in the areas \nof docking, slipping and passenger terminals to ensure the sustainable and safe \noperation of domestic ferries and other passenger carrying vessels. \n \n8. \nEncourage the exploration of means to reduce the excessive cost of servicing \nlifesaving and firefighting equipments, such as establishment of life saving \nappliances (LSA) and firefighting equipments (FFE) service stations. \n \n9. \nThe sharing of best practices and resources across all stakeholders through \nregional associations \n \n10. \nBased on the concept of corporate social responsibility, the stakeholders need \nto encourage the development of long-term maritime personnel retention \npolicies that are supported by continuous training programmes. \n \n11. \nEncourage the development of national and regional search and rescue (SAR) \nresponse and communication plans, that include familiarization programmes \nand the use of appropriate technology and tools such as: \n \na. \nVoluntary community organizations that work alongside national SAR \nservices to provide community awareness and increase search and rescue \ncapacity and capability \n \nb. \nHigh and low level technology for communicating locations of incidents \nand tracking survivors.\n\n11\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n2.1. \nOverview\nWeather is an important component in safe boat operations across the world. In India, there \nare great spatial and temporal variations in climatic characteristics that are reflected in the \nform of localized weather variations across the country. Whereas, the favorable weather can \nsupport boat operators in carrying out safe navigations and organizing pleasure trips, the poor \nweather can spoil the trip and may cause emergency situations that may eventually lead to \nmajor disasters like boat capsizing, collision etc. It is, therefore essential for boat owners and \nwaterways management authorities to pay much attention on weather bulletins and guidelines \nissued by local meteorological organizations to avert boat tragedies.     \n2.1.1 \nForecast of hydro-meteorological events related to passenger boating suffers from \ntechnology and typically short lead-time limitations. However, even with such \nlimitations forecast could be made with a fair degree of accuracy with select technology \nchoices. \n2.2 \nWeather Forecasting for Safe Boat Operations\n2.2.1 \nIndia Meteorological Department (IMD) \n \nIndia Meteorological Department (IMD) is the nodal agency in the Government of \nIndia providing vital information about the meteorological observations, weather \nforecasting and early warning at the national level. The information issued by IMD is \ngainfully utilized in the optimum operation of weather-sensitive activities. IMD issues \nadvance warning information at stipulated intervals to government functionaries, \nmedia and general public against severe weather phenomena like tropical cyclones, \nthunderstorm, dust storms, heavy rains, snow, cold/heat waves etc. The primary \naim of providing warnings ahead of a hazard impact is to empower individuals and \ncommunities to respond appropriately to the hazard threat in order to reduce the \nrisk of death, injury, property loss and damage. It is, therefore, essential for all the \nWeather Forecasting & Early  \nWarning System\n2\n\n12\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nNatioNal Disaster MaNageMeNt guiDeliNes : Boat safety\nstakeholders to keep themselves abreast of the atmospheric disturbance taking \nplace in their locality and how to respond to the emerging threats. A good network \nof various instruments, half hourly satellite information, high end forecasting work \nstations, improved NWP models including auto Nowcast systems and enhanced \ncomputational and communication capabilities are some of the essential requirements \nfor issuing Nowcast warnings with high degree of accuracy. This may enhance the \nlevel of preparedness at the wharf (ghat) or waterways authority level. \n \n2.2.1.1 \nThe weather forecast issued by IMD may be of immense utility to boat \noperators and concerned management authorities to regulate operations \nin waterways during adverse weather events. IMD runs numerical models \nfor generating weather forecasts in different temporal scales which may \nbe used by regional and local waterways management authorities for \nproviding early warning to boat operators.  Summary of the numerical \nforecasting system is given below:\nForecast System\nValidity Period\nGlobal Forecast System\n3-10 days\nWeather Research and Forecast System\n1-3 days\nNowcast\n3 hours\nHurricane (Cyclone) Weather Research and \nForecast\n1-5 days \nMulti Model Ensemble for district forecast\n1-5 days, twice a week\n \n2.2.1.2 \nThe operational forecast and warnings issued for different spatial and \ntemporal domains which may be used for ghat and waterways are as \nunder- \nForecast\nDomain\nTemporal\nSpatial\nNowcast\n3-6 hours \nVenue/ Location\nShort Range \n3 days \nCity/ District/State/Met Sub-division\n \n \n \nThough there are various types of models and forecasts issued by IMD \nin medium to extended range (3 -15 days), these forecasts may not be \nsuitable for real time boat operations as well as for planning purpose .\n \n2.2.1.3 \nNowcast Services for Boat operations\n \n \n \nNowcast technology offers an opportunity to warn boat operators about  \nsevere weather events with short lead times up to 3 hours. Currently, IMD \n\nWeather Forecasting & early Warning system\n13\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nissues Nowcast of localized high impact/ severe weather events such as \nthunderstorms, squalls and other convective weather phenomena for \nabout 206 cities which are covered by Doppler Weather Radars (DWRs).\nThese information can be helpful for boat owners to take timely decisions \non boat operations and safety measures while moving in the water. The \nNowcast warnings are issued in different colors depending upon the \nintensity and are updated at 3 hour intervals.The current Nowcasting \nnetwork of IMD does not cover the entire river systems covering boat \noperations. \n \n \n \nRegarding provision of nowcast for boat operations by IMD, the following \npoints are to be noted.\n \n• \nNo input possible for river channel crossing.\n \n• \nElements of the forecast and scale of warning will depend upon the \ncategory of the vessel and the purpose of the operation for both \nscheduled and non scheduled boat operations.\n \n• \nFor providing the forecast, the details like type of boat, purpose of \nthe boat operation (whether it is of passengers/cargo movement/\npassengers and cargo combined) , starting point and the end point \nof the boat operations with points en route, time schedule and the \ntotal duration of the boat operation  are to be provided.\n \n• \nThe above details to be provided at least one week before for \nscheduled operations and at least one day before for non scheduled \noperations.\n \n• \nThe forecast provided will include the information like possible \noccurrence of severe weather including its intensity which will be \nupdated in every three hours.\n \n2.2.1.4. \nDissemination of Nowcast information\n \n \n \nIn view of the typically short lead time in Nowcasts and the perishable \nnature of the generated information, the Nowcast information should \nreach the end users well in advance.  The fastest mode of communication \nshould be used for the dissemination of Nowcast warnings like World Wide \nWeb, e-mail, Fax, telephone, mobile, SMS, TV, radio communication, flag \nhoisting, public announcements/ Sirens etc.\n\n14\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nNatioNal Disaster MaNageMeNt guiDeliNes : Boat safety\n \n \n \nThe forecast products in different spatial as well as time scales suitable \nfor the purpose are already being issued by IMD. These products are \nbeing made available in the IMD website immediately after their issue. \nHence provision should be made by inland water Authority to access \nand extract the forecast and warning information of IMD pertaining to \nthe State, Subdivision, District and City levels. Suitable mobile based \nAPP may be developed by the authority to access and extract all the \nrequired information along with the route forecast issued for boat \noperations. Arrangements to be made for the display of the relevant \nweather information which can be hazardous for the boat operation for \nthe knowledge of the boat operators as well as the public.\n2.2.2 \nCentral Water Commission (CWC)\n \nCentral Water Commission (CWC) is the technical agency of water resources and flood \nmanagement working under the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development \nand Ganga Rejuvenation, Government of India. The organization is entrusted with the \ntask of formulating and disseminating information about flood forecasts at various \ninterstate river locations.CWC maintains 878 hydrological observation stations and \n199 flood forecasting stations which include 151 level and 48 inflow forecast stations \nspread across 20 states and union territories and 19 inter-state river systems in the \ncountry. The work of formulation and dissemination of flood forecasts under various \ninter-state river basins is carried out directly by 27 Flood Forecasting Divisions which \nare designated as Divisional Flood Control Rooms (DFCR). Flood forecasts are issued \n6 to 24 hours in advance depending on the travel time available between base station \nto FF station and available time of concentration up to flood forecasting stations. \nCWC has also started rainfall based mathematical modelling to generate 3-day flood \nadvisories for all the flood forecasting stations for 2017 monsoon.\n \nThere are two types of forecast issued by CWC – Stage forecast or level Forecast \ngives information about water level in rivers and Inflow forecast provides information \nabout the likely amount of inflow into the dams /barrages. All these information can \nbe helpful in streamlining safe operations of boats and other cargo during monsoon \nperiod or high discharge situation in river channels.    \n \n2.2.2.1 \nIn order to improve the safety of boat operations, there is a need for \nstrengthening the scientific, technical and operational meteorological \nsupport system in a holistic manner at the national, state and local \n\nWeather Forecasting & early Warning system\n15\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nforecasting offices so that accurate and precise warnings can be circulated \nto boat operators and other stakeholders. Improved forecasting of hydro-\nmeteorological hazards require more robust observational systems \nfor the atmosphere, oceans, and land surface. Communication system \nand computational capabilities at the national, State and local level \nand infra-structure facilities like forecasting work stations/ computer \nplatforms & Public Weather System at state/ local level  requires  physical  \nstrengthening and improvement. All these communication networks and \ninfrastructural facilities are to be located in state, districts and local EOCs. \n \n2.2.2.2 \nThe hydrological forecast should be generated through hydrological \nmodeling based on scientific use of reliable hydrological and meteorological \nreal-time data, river morphological data, catchment characteristic data \netc. \n2.3 \nImplementation Programme-Roles and Responsibilities of various agencies\nEarly warning/forecasting for boat safety demands a three-tier implementation i.e. at national, \nstate and local level.  At each of these levels, however, the action plan would require the \nconcerted efforts of all stakeholders that operate at that level. Respondents, stake holders, \nNGOs, local community need to be clearly identified.\n2.3.1 \nNational Level –\n \n \nEarly warning and Nowcast products to be issued at national, regional, state \nand local level required for safe boating.

Design of boats to meet the safety specifications and to   conform to \noperational standards would form the    first and the foremost desirable structural support to \n‘mitigation and management of risks’ in the boat travel. The second and the equally important \nsupport structure for safe boats operation is the “Wharf Facility” which can be accomplished \nwith their modernization and advanced embankment arrangements in the form of floating Jetty-\ninfrastructure, and related support systems. The enforcement of adopting the standard designs \nand operating regimes of boat navigation requires active cooperation from boat manufacturers \nand operators, whereas the responsibility of ensuring availability of boats, modernization of \nwharfs with suitable embankments rest with the state governments. However, the successful \nimplementation and enforcement of safety standards is largely dependent on the proactive \nrole to be played by local administration including Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs), State and \nDistrict Disaster Management Authorities and other local level functionaries. \n3.2. \nBoat Design, Trends and Practices\n3.2 .1 \nMost of the passenger boats or country crafts are constructed in a primitive or \ntraditional style by using locally available material especially woods. The traditional \nboat construction styles are carried forward from one generation to the next \ngeneration thereby having less scope of modernization. Some of the boats are, \nhowever, mechanized using agricultural pumps, engine and propeller systems. \nHowever, most of the boats do not have gear boxes for reduction of speeds or for \nproviding mechanism for reversing. In addition, many of the boat-designs have low \nfree board which is unsafe for carrying passengers. \nSafety Standards &  \nSpecifications\n3\n\n18\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nNatioNal Disaster MaNageMeNt guiDeliNes : Boat safety\n3.3. \nGeneral Safety Measures -\n3.3.1 \nConstruction and Structural Strength\n \nThe design, construction and materials of the hull structure as well as machineries \nand equipments should be suitably designed to ensure safe operations of boats for \nthe intended services. It is, therefore, recommended that all new boats should be \ndesigned & constructed as per the recognized standards and construction rules of \nthe certification body. \n \nIn case of existing boats, it should be demonstrated by the history of safe operation \nof the boat or similar design of boats that the construction of the vessels is adequate \nfor the service.\n3.3.2. \nFreeboard and Stability\n \nFreeboard is defined as the minimum vertical distance from the waterline to the top \nof deck at side in case of a decked boat or to the top of side in an open boat.  This \ncorresponds with the full load condition and gives a good measure of the safety of \nthe boat. The freeboard values are assigned by certifying authority ‘Indian Register \nof Shipping’ according to the applicable rules. The Freeboard values increase with \nthe length of the boat. When freeboard is not assigned, the following values may be \nrecommended-\nTypes of Boat\nBoat Length\nFreeboard\nDecked Boats\nUp to 7 meters\n120 mm\n18 meters & above\n240 mm\nOpen Boats\nUp to 7 meters\n240 mm\n18 meters & above\n480 mm\n\t\nTable\t–\tFreeboard\tvalues\tfor\tdifferent\tboat\tlength\t\n \nFor Intermediate length in both the cases, freeboard values may be interpolated. The \nStability of a boat is checked by the certification body (Indian Register of Shipping). \nIn case of boats, which already exist, the certifying body may use a heeling test to \nverify the stability of boats for carrying the specified number of passengers. \n3.3.3. \nRegistration Number and Seating Capacity on Board\n \nIt may be a good practice to keep mandatory provisions for boats to have registration \nwith the local statutory body such as Inland Water Transport Department of the \nconcerned State. The Registration number should be prominently marked on the \nboat on a particular place as decided by the authority. \n\nSafety StandardS & SpecificationS\n19\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n \nSince overloading is one of the common reasons of boat accidents, it is necessary to \ndetermine the maximum number of persons that can be safely carried on each boat \nand clearly marked on the boat. The carrying capacity of the boat should be primarily \ndetermined by stability and space considerations. The floor space required may be \nbased on 1.8 square meter per person. In case of long seats or benches, two persons \nmay be accommodated per meter of the seat.\n3.3.4 \nMonitoring and Maintenance\n \nThe statutory body responsible for regulating boat operations should frame out rules \nand regulations for monitoring and periodical examination of boats. The operators \nshould have to satisfy themselves about the integrity of the vessel’s hull by an out \nof water examination at least every 3 years and 2 years in case of wooden vessels, \nwhich  should be documented.  In addition, the external components of steering and \npropulsion machinery and shell fittings should also be examined out of the water.  \nThe documented report of such examination should be made available on board for \nverification by statutory bodies, passengers associations, local NGOs, interested users \netc.\n3.3.5 \nSafety Briefings \n \nAt the start of every voyage or trip, the master operator or other responsible crew \nmembers should give safety briefing to passengers. The safety briefing should consist \nof restrictions about the movement on board, emergency procedures, location of \nemergency exits, stowage and use of personal protective equipments such as life \njackets and life buoys.\n3.3.6. \nWharfs/ Jetties\n \nThe availability of proper infrastructures at each wharf/Jetty for embarkation and \ndisembarkation are equally important for safe boating. It should be the responsibility \nof local authorities to provide adequate facilities. Wherever any variation in water level \nexists in rivers or harbors, the appropriate stairways and landings should be provided \ncovering the whole range of water levels for safe embarkation/disembarkation. The \nfloating facilities may also be used for embarkation/ disembarkation.  Suitable barges \nfor landing should be arranged with gangways/ ladders connected to shore for this \npurpose. In addition, floating or fixed jetties are to be provided with appropriate \nfenders to prevent damage to the boats while berthing. Rubber fenders are suitable \nfor this purpose.\n\n20\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nNatioNal Disaster MaNageMeNt guiDeliNes : Boat safety\n3.4 \nSafety standards for Non-mechanized Boats\n3.4.1 \nLife Saving Equipments\n \nEvery boat should have approved life saving equipments sufficient for the number \nof persons that can be carried. IRS/MMD approved lifesaving appliances such as life \njackets, life buoy etc. confirming to latest SOLAS/LSA Code requirement along with \nidentification/marking details on the product. (Also Refer Annexure-I to Chapter 3 \nfor details)\n \n3.4.1.1 \nLife buoys\n \n \n \nIt is recommended that at least one lifebuoy should be provided for every \n5 passengers, with a minimum of 2 lifebuoys on the boat.  \n \n3.4.1.2 \nLife jackets:\n \n \n \nIn general, life jackets are not required for boats operating in the calm \nwater.  However, it is recommended that as a good practice, passengers \nshould be provided life jackets before the journey begins. All the life saving \nappliances should be properly maintained and periodically serviced based \non the recommendations by the manufacturing company.\n \n3.4.1.3 \nFirst Aid Box should be kept essentially in every boat with all the emergency \nfirst aid equipments and medications to be used in case of emergency.\n3.4.2 \nFire Safety\n \nAt least one multipurpose portable fire extinguisher of a recognized standard should \nbe carried in all the vessels navigating in inland waterways. In order to prevent fire \naccidents, it is strongly suggested that the following items should be prohibited to \nbe carried on boats.\n \na) \nLamps powered by liquefied gas or liquid oil\n \nb) \nVaporizing oil burner stoves\n \nc) \nSolid fuel heaters\n \nd) \nDevices fitted with wick burners\n \ne) \nLiquefied gas devices\n \nAll the boat operators should display posters on board indicating items prohibited to \nbe carried in the vessels.\n \nSmoking shall be strictly prohibited in the boats.\n\nSafety StandardS & SpecificationS\n21\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n3.4.3 \nNavigation and Communication \n \n3.4.3.1. \nNavigation lights and Sound signals\n \n \n \nThe Vessels operating at night should be equipped with navigation lights \nas required by the local authority. This may enable ferry/vessels operators \nto get acquaintance with the routes or possible dangers during navigation. \nThe appropriate sound signaling equipment should also be provided in \nall vessels.\n \n3.4.3.2. \nCommunication Equipment\n \n \n \nIn order to disseminate distress communication, all boat operators should \ncarry emergency communication equipments. The mobile phones are \nnormally sufficient for this purpose provided operation area has signal \ncoverage. In other cases portable VHF may be required. The authorities \nto be informed in case of emergency should be clearly indicated on \nboard .The communication equipments for receiving weather forecast \nand warnings are also essential depending on the area of operation. This \nmay be arranged at the landing points onshore and boat operators be \ninformed by the administrative authorities. \n3.4.4. \nAnchoring and Mooring\n \nIn order to prevent drifting of vessels in the area of operations during calm weather in \ngeneral and cyclonic conditions in particular, it is essential to keep suitable anchoring \nequipments on board like Anchors, Cables and Ropes etc. The anchoring arrangements \nmay be helpful for holding the boats especially during unstable weather conditions.\n \nThe Mooring arrangements consisting of bollards or cleats and mooring ropes are to \nbe provided suitably for the vessel.\n3.5. \nSafety standards for Mechanized Boats\nIn mechanized boats, safety standards must be followed as the top priority especially to ensure \nthat machinery failure is avoided to avert potential disasters. It must also be ensured that \npropulsion machinery is reliable and may not be stranded in mid waterways due to machinery \nfailure. An important safety measure for mechanized boats is the possibility to apply reverse \nthrust which may be achieved by means of gears that may enable boat operators to quickly \nstop the boat for avoiding possible collision. In addition, prevention of fire and explosion in \nboats should also be ensured important safety measures for mechanical boats.    \n\n22\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nNatioNal Disaster MaNageMeNt guiDeliNes : Boat safety\nIn order to maintain general safety measures in mechanized boats, the major thrust should \nbe on protecting people from the imminent danger of machineries. The moving parts and hot \nsurfaces are to be protected so as to minimize danger to people during normal movement of \nvessels. All fuel tank vents should be fitted with a ‘flame gauze’ and carried above the tank top \nlevel, to above a height of personnel standing next to the engine or to a level where there is no \ndanger of escaping fuel or vapour. A valve or cock, which can be shut from a position outside \nthe engine space should be fitted in the fuel feed pipe, as close to the fuel tanks as possible. \nPetrol tanks for outboard motors should have quick connection shutoff devices.\n3.5.1 \nSafety measures for fuel storage\n \nIn mechanized boats, safety measures for fuel storage tanks should be undertaken \nwith utmost caution and safety. The following precautions are recommended for fire \nsafety of storage tanks in mechanized boats. \n \n• \nThe storage container should be composed of metal and fitted in such a manner \nthat the possibility of leaks/spills may be averted.\n \n• \nThe container should be stored upright and secured to prevent shifting or fall \nover with the movement of the vessel. They should also be located away from \nthe direct sources of heat and should be made of fire resistant materials. \n \n• \nThe container should be properly labeled according to contents like materials \nstored, hazard signs, no smoking/ignition sources etc. \n3.5.2 \nSafety Measures for Petrol Engines and Petrol Fuels \n \nThe fixed petrol tanks of more than 2.5 liters should not be located within one metre \nof any engine or heating appliance unless insulated and protected by fire resistant \nmaterials.  It is recommended not to use glass or plastic fuel sight gauges .The fuel \nlevel indicators should be designed in such a way that it should not allow fuel to escape \nin the event of damage. All the fixed fuel feed pipes should be of metallic type. The \nflexible pipes should be of fire resistant materials.  \n3.5.3 \nCharging Devices\n \nArrangements of charging facilities for batteries should be ensured on board, so that \nboats machineries are started /operated through batteries smoothly . In other boats \nwhere battery is the sole means of starting the engine, provisions be made duplicate \nbatteries with change over switches for emergency uses. \n3.5.4 \nLighting Arrangements\n \nWhen lighting within the vessel is provided through a centralized electrical system , \nan alternative source of lighting should be provided for emergency use . This may be \n\nSafety StandardS & SpecificationS\n23\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nensured by means of torches provided on board. Alternative source of lighting is to \nbe ensured for the movement of people, deployment of life saving appliances and \nto work on essential machinery.  \n3.5.5 \nSteering Arrangements\n \nEach vessel should be provided with effective means of steering.  Emergency steering \narrangements are recommended where there are safety risks of passengers due to \nmain steering failure. This may be in the form of a tiller which can be attached to the \nrudder stock or steering oar depending on the area of operation.\n3.5.6 \nBilge Pumping/ Drainage Arrangements\n \nAll the vessels plying in the waterways should have means of bilge pumping either \nby a power driven pump or a hand pump so that all compartments can be drained \nduring emergency. In machinery spaces, a holding tank is recommended for oily bilges \nto prevent water pollution. In case of small open boats operating in areas with small \nwave height of less than 0.6 m, drainage with the help of bailers or buckets may be \nsufficient.\n3.5.7 \nLife Saving Equipments\n \nEach boat should have approved life saving equipments sufficient for the number of \npersons that can be carried on board. IRS/MMD approved lifesaving appliances such \nas life jackets, life buoy etc. confirming to latest SOLAS/LSA Code requirement along \nwith identification/marking details on the product (Also Refer Annexure-I to Chapter \n3 for details). It should be mandatory to keep the following life saving equipments \non every mechanized boats/vessels.\n \n3.5.7.1 \nLife Buoys\n \n \n \nA minimum of 4 Life Buoys for vessels up to 25 meter length, 6 Life Buoys \nfor vessels of 25 to 45 meters length and 8 Life Buoys for more than 45 \nmeters length should be carried in vessels.\n \n3.5.7.2 \nLife Jackets\n \n \n \nThough Life Jackets are not required for vessels operating in areas of less \nthan 0.6 meters wave height, however in other areas , life jackets are to \nbe carried for all passengers and crews.  \n \n3.5.7.3 \nLife Rafts\n \n \n \nIn case of vessels operating in areas of more than 1.2 meter wave height, \nsufficient number of life rafts for accommodating people on board is \n\n24\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nNatioNal Disaster MaNageMeNt guiDeliNes : Boat safety\nrecommended. While keeping all life saving equipments, it is essential \nto ensure periodic maintenance and servicing following manufacturer’s \nrecommendations. In a similar manner, ‘First Aid’ box should be kept on \nboard for passengers and crew members like mechanized boats.  \n3.5.8 \nFire Safety Measures\n \nSince mechanized boats are largely operated by means of electrical and mechanical \ndevices, there are more chances of catching fire, thus well structured fire fighting \nsystem must be essentially maintained in mechanized boats. The following equipments \nare required to be kept in vessels.  \n \n3.5.8.1. \nFire pump  A vessel of 6 meter and above in length should carry hand pumps \nor power driven pumps with hose  connections capable of delivering a jet \nof water to any part of the vessel through hose and nozzles. \n \n3.5.8.2. \nFire Extinguishers\n \n \n \nAt least one multipurpose portable fire extinguisher to a recognized \nstandard is to be carried in all vessels, which is to be kept outside the \nengine space. In addition, one multipurpose fire extinguisher should \nbe placed at each exit from accommodation spaces to open decks.  In \naddition, Fire Buckets and Lanyards are also to be provided in the boats. \nIt is recommended that all fire fighting equipments are to be maintained \nin good conditions.\n \n \n \nLike non mechanized boats, the following items should not be carried on \nboard in all the mechanized boats -   \n \na) \nLamps powered by liquefied gas or liquid oil\n \nb) \nVaporizing oil burner stoves\n \nc) \nSolid fuel heaters\n \nd) \nDevices fitted with wick burners\n \ne) \nLiquefied gas devices\n \nSmoking shall be strictly prohibited in the boats.\n3.5.9 \nNavigation and Communication Aids\n \nThe provisions of navigation and communication arrangements should be managed \nin the same manner like non mechanized boats.\n \nAnchoring and Mooring arrangements for mechanized boats should also follow the \npattern of non mechanized boats. \n\nSafety StandardS & SpecificationS\n25\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n3.6. \nImplementation Plan- Roles & Responsibilities of various agencies \n3.6.1. \nNon-mechanized boats\n \nThe responsibility of the implementation of safety standards and specifications \nprimarily rest with the state governments. The Inland Waterways Authority of India \n(IWAI) may be requested to extend the scope of application of model rules to non-\nmechanized boats, which could then be adopted by state governments. The respective \ndepartments in all the concerned states may be empowered to implement the rules.\n3.6.2. \nMechanized boats\n \nThe responsibility of the implementation in case of mechanized boats also rests with \nthe state governments following the similar pattern of non mechanized boats. The \nstate government may also requires to update rules in line with the “model rules of \nIWAI “.Government departments with qualified personnel such as Inland Waterways \nTransport department, ports and harbors department, captain of ports etc. would \nbe responsible for implementation of the rules. The Governments may also use the \nservices of their maritime boards, wherever established for this purpose.\n \nIt is recommended that all the states having river transportation as means of \ncommunication should be set up Inland Waterways Transport Department, if not done. \nThe department may be responsible for the development and implementation of boat \nsafety regulations. The respective state governments may also authorize Classification \nSocieties like Indian register of Shipping for specific certification purpose, as done by \nDG Shipping for seagoing vessels. Rules of state governments already rely upon class \nsociety requirements for construction aspects. \n \nThe updation of existing IWAI rules require some considerable time as it involves \nsetting up of a committee and deliberations, preparation of draft rules, invitation \nof comments and final gazette notification. This process may take about one year, \nconsidering the need to address various shortcomings in the rules. Once the updated \nrules are published, it can be applied to all new boats, whereas the existing boats may \nbe given some time frame (1-2 years) to implement the regulations in a progressive \nmanner. \n \nAs the existing non-mechanized boats are not subjected to robust regulatory practices, \napplication of the rules to such boats will be time consuming. The existing non-\nmechanized boats may be required to comply with the safety requirements other \nthan construction. It is suggested that a period of one to two years should be given to \nexisting non-mechanized boats to progressively comply with the new rules. The local \n\n26\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nNatioNal Disaster MaNageMeNt guiDeliNes : Boat safety\nnon mechanized boat builders are also required to follow appropriate construction \nrules for new boats.  A time frame of two years may be given for the implementation \nof rules.\n\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n27\nIRS/MMD approved lifesaving appliances such as life jackets, life buoy etc. confirming to latest \nSOLAS/LSA Code requirement along with identification/marking details on the product are to \nbe used.\nThe life saving appliances be clearly marked with approval information and any operational \nrestrictions.\nLifejackets (Infants/Child/Adult) shall be marked by their weight or height, or by both weight \nand height.\nIn addition, infant or child life jackets shall be marked with:-\n \na) \nSize range\n \nb) \nan “infant” or “child” symbol as adopted by International Maritime Organization \n(IMO) resolution A.760(18), as amended.\nThe container of inflatable liferaft shall be marked with:-\n \na. \nMaker’s name or trademark\n \nb. \nSerial number\n \nc. \nName of approving authority and the number of the persons it is permitted to \ncarry,\n \nd. \nSOLAS\n \ne. \nType of emergency pack enclosed\n \nf. \nDate when last serviced\n \ng. \nLength of painter\n \nh. \nMass of the packed liferaft, if greater than 185 kg.\nThe following IRS website link gives the product details and manufacturer on using the search \nfunction for the relevant item. \nhttp://www.irclass.org/marine/types-and-works-approval/\nAnnexure-I \nto Chapter 3\n\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n29\n4.1. \nOverview\nInland Waterways Transport (IWT) finds a place in all the three lists i.e. Union List, State List \nand Concurrent List within the 7th Schedule of the Constitution of India, which underline the \nimportance attached to this mode of transportation. The constitutional provisions for shipping \nand navigation in the inland waterways (National Waterways) as regards to mechanically \npropelled vessels fall under the Union List. Communication, that is to say, roads, bridges, \nferries and other means of communication not specified in the Union List, inland waterways, \nand traffic thereon subject to the provision of Union List and Concurrent List with regard to \nsuch waterways comes under the State List.  \n4.2. \nRegulatory Provisions of National Waterways\nThe Government of India constituted an Autonomous Body i.e. Inland Waterways Authority \nof India (IWAI) by an Act of Parliament i.e. Inland Waterways Authority of India Act, 1985 (82 \nof 1985). The role of IWAI is to deal with matters pertaining to shipping and navigation on \nNational Waterways (NWs) inter-alia to create necessary infrastructural facilities, maintain a \nnavigable fairway, provide channel marking for safe navigation etc.\nEarlier, five Waterways were declared as ‘National Waterways’ by separate acts of parliament:\n4.2.1. \nNational Waterway- 1 extending from rivers Ganga – Bhagirathi to Hooghly covering \ncities from Allahabad to Haldia (1620 kms). It was declared as National Waterway in \n1986.\n4.2.2. \nNational Waterway- 2 on the river Brahmaputra extends from Sadiyato Dhubri (891 \nkms) in Assam was declared as National Waterway in 1988.\n4.2.3. \nNational Waterway- 3 The west coastal Canals from Kollam (Kerala) to Kottapuram \nalong with Champakara and Udyogmandal canals (205 kms) was declared as National \nWaterway 3 in 1993.\nRegulatory  \n& Legal Issues\n4\n\n30\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nNatioNal Disaster MaNageMeNt guiDeliNes : Boat safety\n4.2.4. \nNational Waterway- 4 on rivers Godavari & Krishna along with canals between Kakinada \nand Pondicherry (1027 kms) was declared as National Waterway 4 in 2008.\n4.2.5. \nNational Waterway- 5 covering routes on rivers Brahmani and Mahanadi delta system \nalong with east coast canal(588 kms) was declared as National Waterway 5 in 2008.\n4.2.6 \nThe National Waterways Act, 2016 (No. 17 of 2016) was passed in both houses of \nParliament and published in the Gazette of India on 26.03.2016. This Act makes \nprovisions for existing National Waterways and to provide for declaration of certain \ninland waterways and also to provide for the regulation and development of the said \nwaterways for the purposes of shipping and navigation and for matters connected \ntherewith or incidental thereto. 111 National Waterways have been declared as \nNational Waterways including the existing five National Waterways. The copy of \nthe Gazette Notification which includes the list of 111 Waterways in the schedule is \nenclosed as Annexure:1 at the end of the guidelines.\n4.3. \nLegal Coverage and Regulatory Mechanism\nThe navigational safety is of paramount importance for inland waterways, more so when traffic \non the National Waterways is poised for an exponential growth in the coming years. \nThe IWAI Act 1985 empowers IWAI to enact, publish rules and regulations on matters pertaining \nto safety measures as well as development and management of inland waterways for the \npurposes of safe navigation and shipping and connected matters/incidentals thereto, removal \nof obstructions/encroachments from the Waterways, Safe Cargo loading/unloading on the \nInland terminals, control of water pollution and to stop vessels running on national waterways \nwithout permit/license.\nBy virtue of the above, IWAI has already published through Gazette Notifications the following \nrules & regulations:-\n \ni) \nPrevention of Collision on National Waterways Regulations, 2002; \n \nii) \nNational Waterways, Safety of Navigation and Shipping Regulations, 2002\n \niii) \nInland Waterways Authority of India (Classification of Inland Waterways in India) \nRegulations, 2006  and\n4.3.1 \nThe Inland vessels Act, 1917 as amended by The Inland Vessels (Amendment) Act, \n2007 \n\nRegulatoRy & legal Issues\n31\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nThe Inland Vessels Act, 1917 (1 of 1917)\nAs regards to all mechanically propelled vessels, the primary applicable Act is the Inland Vessels \nAct, 1917 (1 of 1917) which confers the powers to the State Governments for enforcement of the \nvarious provisions of this Act. This Act has been amended in 2007 and many important aspects have \nbeen added and amended so that the Act is more contemporary. The various Chapters in this Act are:\nChapter I \n- \nPreliminary\nChapter II \n- \nSurvey of Inland Mechanically Propelled Vessels\nChapter II A \n - \nRegistration of Inland [Mechanically Propelled Vessels]  \nChapter III \n- \n Masters Including Serangs and Engineers including Engine – Drivers of Inland \nMechanically Propelled Vesse\nChapter IV \n- \nInvestigation into Casualties\nChapter IV A \n- \nRemoval of Obstructions and Similar Hazards in Navigation\nChapter V \n- \nSuspension and Cancellation of Certificates\n \n \nGranted under Inland Vessels Act, 1917\nChapter VI \n- \nProtection of and Carriage of Passengers\n \n \nin, Inland Mechanically Propelled Vessels\nChapter VI A \n- \nInsurance of Mechanically Propelled vessel\n \n \nAgainst Third Party Risks\nChapter VI AB \n- \nPrevention and Control of Pollution and Protection\n \n \nOf Inland Water\nChapter VII \n- \nPenalties and Legal Proceedings.\nChapter VIII \n- \nSupplemental\n \nThe adoption & implementation of these regulations and acts would help generate \nawareness on issues of navigational safety and primarily would be useful to all the \nstakeholders in using the IWT mode of transportation in a safe and efficient manner \nacross the country. All inland mechanically propelled vessels irrespective of the BHP \nof the propulsion engine and including outboard motors come under the ambit of \nThe Inland Vessels  Act, 1917 (1 of 1917) and therefore are to be governed by this Act \nby the State Governments. These vessels which may be ferries used for passenger or \ngoods transportation on inland waterway or national waterways are to compulsorily \ncomply with the provisions of Inland Vessels Act, 1917. For this, it is imperative that \neach State Government formulate their Rules under this Act and may implement  \nthe same in their State. This will require formation of an IWT Department at the state \nlevel and proper mechanism of survey and registration of the boats at the district \nlevel. \n\n32\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nNatioNal Disaster MaNageMeNt guiDeliNes : Boat safety\n4.4. \nFerries Acts and Rules\nSome of the prominent acts and rules are under vogue for mechanized and non-mechanized \nferries which are the major constituents of all the vessels that are operated throughout the \nlength and breadth of the country. They are as follows:\n \ni) \nBengal Ferries Act, 1885\n \nii) \nNorthern India Ferries Act (I), 1878\n \niii) \nThe Bihar Ferries Manual of 1956\n \niv) \nControl and Management of Ferries, Rules of 1968\n \nv) \nTravancore Public Canals and Public Ferries Act of 1096\n \nvi) \nThe Cochin Public Canals and Backwaters Navigation Act, 1092 \n4.4.1 \nThese acts summarily provide guidelines for operation of boats in State Waterways \ncovering the following aspects.\n \na) \nThe Registration/Licensing/Inspection/Certification of Boats.\n \nb) \nRegulation of the following:\n \n• \nDimensions and Free board\n \n• \nEquipment including LSA/FFA\n \n• \nNumber of Passengers\n \n• \nNature and quantity of cargo to be carried.\n \n• \nSpeed of Boats/Vessels.\n \n• \nLights to be exhibited.\n \n• \nMooring of Boats/Vessels\n \n• \nInfrastructural facilities.\n \nc) \nDefining the line of navigation and regulating the navigation of boats/vessels \nincluding limits to prevent danger to other boats/vessels, banks, navigation \nmarks etc. & the mode of operation of ferries private operators including the \nfacilities & manpower to be provided by the operators for safety of navigation \n& personnel. \n \nd) \nDuties, Powers and Qualifications of boat/vessel inspectors, Operators and crew.\n \ne) \nProcedures to be followed in case of emergencies/accidents.\n \nf) \nPenalty for breach of rules.\n\nRegulatoRy & legal Issues\n33\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n4.5 \nExisting Rules\nThe Working Group studied various existing rules for reference. These include:-\n4.5.1 \nInland Steam Vessels (Construction and Survey) Rules 1965,Govt. of Goa, Daman, Diu\n4.5.2 \nInland Steam Vessels (Construction and survey) Rules 1957, Govt. of Maharashtra.\n4.5.3 \nDraft Inland Steam Vessels (Construction and Survey) Rules 1975, Govt. of Maharashtra.\n4.5.4 \nKerala Inland Vessels Rules 2010.\n4.5.5 \nDraft Model Rules for Inland Vessels 2012 of Inland Waterways Authority of India.\n4.5.6 \nConstruction Rules for Inland Waterways vessels by IWAI.\n4.5.7 \nBihar Govt. Rules 2013 \n4.6 \nRegulatory regime for travel by people using passenger boats\nPassenger boats broadly fall into two categories- Mechanized or propelled boats and Non-\npropelled boats. The regulatory regime for the above categories can cover the following aspects. \n4.6.1 \nFor Mechanized or propelled boats  \n \n4.6.1.1 \nFor the safe navigation of Mechanized boats, the boats are to be registered \nunder Inland Vessels Act, 1917 and adhere to Standards which are to be \npromulgated by the State Governments. The Inland Water Transport Dte. \nof State Governments is to be formed in all States to look into the aspects \nof navigation in canal, lakes and rivers which constitute inland waterways \nof  that State.\n \n4.6.1.2 \nSufficient qualified manpower to register and survey all mechanized or \npropelled boats in all districts of the States is a step forward to be taken \nby all State Governments. The overloading of passengers & goods is the \nmost important reason of accidents. Therefore, the numbers of passengers \npermitted are to be determined & prescribed during registration of \nmechanized boats which is to be done by the State IWT Directorate/\nMaritime Board who looks after IWT issues in the state. It is suggested that \nthe mechanized boats may be allowed to carry 2/3rd of their passenger \ncapacity when boat is operating in adverse weather conditions or during \nhigh currents or floods. The enforcement of limiting number to ensure that \nthese are not beyond the prescribed limits/numbers calls for involvement, \nawareness and training of boat operators, local panchayat level officers \nand district administration.\n\n34\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nNatioNal Disaster MaNageMeNt guiDeliNes : Boat safety\n \n4.6.1.3 \nFurther, regulations pertaining to all aspects dealing with construction, \nmanning, stability, powering, Essential Safety Appliances (ESA), Fire \nFighting Appliances (FFA) etc. have to be promulgated by State Government \nwhich would help in curbing the number of accidents and loss of men & \nmaterial.\n4.6.2 \nFor Non- mechanized passenger boats\n \n4.6.2.1 \nThe non-mechanized passenger boats do not fall under the purview of the \nInland Vessels Act, 1917 and are governed by various Ferries Act of various \nstates. These Acts also do not cover the technical aspects of operation of \nboats. \n \n4.6.2.2 \nAn exercise to amalgamate all these Ferries Acts and making one new Act \nfor construction, operation & maintenance of Non – Mechanized boats \nmay have to be made and adopted by each of the States. This may be a \nCentral Act or alternatively Central Govt. can frame Model Act which can \nbe adopted by each State after State specific modifications, as required.\n \n4.6.2.3 \nTill such an Act is put into place some important guidelines/issues for \nimproving safety of non-mechanized boat operations are proposed as \nfollows:-\n \n(i) \nNon- mechanized boats or ferries may be registered with local \npanchayats or District Administration.\n \n(ii) \nEach boat may have a distinguishing registration number along with \nprescribed number of persons it is permitted to carry displayed \nprominently.\n \n(iii) \nPeriodically the boats may be checked for water tightness and river \nworthiness by experienced boatmen who are familiar with the local \nconditions. \n \n(iv) \nThe boat found lacking in any of the aspects during checking, would \nhave to be repaired for making it river worthy. \n \n(v) \n Local informal forums of boatmen may be formed and one or two \ndesignated boatmen in these forums may be assigned the task of \ngiving periodical information to local panchayat about any boat \nfound not to be river worthy. \n\nRegulatoRy & legal Issues\n35\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n \n(vi) \nGram Panchayat/District Administration may be empowered to \ncheck river worthiness of boats, issue directions for not plying till \nit is made river worthy. \n \n(vii) Gram Panchayat/ District Administration to periodically have surprise \nchecks to ensure that the passengers are not being carried in excess \nof the prescribed capacity.\n \n(viii) In adverse weather or river conditions, boatmen have to be made \naware by best available means, like SMS, Public Address System, \nHoisting of suitable flags etc.  not to carry out boating operations \ntill the conditions have improved or become favorable.\n \n(ix) \nLess number of passengers may be permitted during adverse weather \nor river conditions. \n \n(x) \nLocal certification of boatmen by Gram Panchayats into two \ncategories such as skilled or semiskilled may be made. Able bodied \nskilled boatmen having greater knowledge of local conditions may \nonly be allowed for boats carrying more than 20-25 passengers.\n \n(xi) \nSafety awareness campaigns at Gram Panchayats both for boatmen \nas well as for passengers to be carried out at least once in three \nmonths be made, perhaps through NGOs.\n \n(xii) Introduction of the provision of some Life Saving Appliances such as \nbuoys or buoyant apparatus in the boats is to be made mandatory.\n \n(xiii) Local marking of channels for safe boating from one end to another \nto enable the boatmen to stay on course may be provided by the \nPanchayats. Generally the locals already have this knowledge.\n \n(xiv) Provision of proper landing facilities for boats at various ghats, \nillumination of these facilities where operations take place after \nsunset or dusk be made.\n \n(xv) Emphasis may be given to mark areas which are accident prone or \nwhere due to changes in water levels, grounding may occur. Such \nmarkings would prevent grounding of boats. \n \n(xvi) Wherever large number of boats operates in a particular area, District \nAdministration may have Boat Inspectors for checking of boats and \ntraining of boatmen.\n\n36\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nNatioNal Disaster MaNageMeNt guiDeliNes : Boat safety\n \n(xvii) Introduction of concepts of naval architecture such as minimum \nfreeboard, reserve buoyancy, subdivision may be slowly started \nin boat building processes as well by suitably qualified technical \npersons at District level to the local Gram Panchayat& boatmen \ninvolved in boat building activity.\n \n(xviii) Data collection of passenger boat operations including details of \naccidents/incidents happening to be done by the State Govt. on \nyearly basis and forwarded to the Central Govt. Even now this is \nbeing done to a limited extent and some data is available on National \nCrime Records Bureau website. This, however, needs to be done \nexhaustively. The representatives of Panchayats of those States \nwhich have more accidents may be encouraged to visit the States \nwith less/no boat accident to understand and follow some of their \npractices.\n \n(xix) Campaigns for bringing in awareness amongst passengers not to rush \nto one side of the boat in case of water ingress to avoid capsizing due \nto tilting of boats would also help in reducing the boat accidents. \n \n(xx) Provision of imposing a penalty on the boat operator not adhering \nto the above guidelines is to be constituted by the State Govt./Local \nAdministration. \n4.7 \nImplementation Plan-Roles & Responsibilities\n4.7.1 \nThe responsibility of implementation of rules and regulations related to safety of inland \nvessels primarily rests with State Governments. However no state government has an \nadequate organizational set up which is capable (in quality and quantity) to handle \nvarious legal issues related to safety of inland vessels including boats on policy level \nas well day to day level. Hence the first and foremost requirement is that each and \nevery state government should develop institutional / organizational set up to frame \nrelevant rules and regulations and implement them in an effective manner. This is \nconsidered the primary requirement towards safety in navigation by boat and other \ninland vessels.\n4.7.2 \nThe working group is of the opinion that in the organization set up suggested above \nthere should be one separate wing for handling matters related to non-mechanical \nor mechanized country boats. Such county boats have been plying in almost every \n\nRegulatoRy & legal Issues\n37\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nbig and small river and the other water bodies (lakes, creeks etc.) which are playing \nan extremely important role in meeting the transport needs of country sides. These \nboats also do not have any standard design. Every region of the country has distinct \ndesign of boats developed over the years based on local conditions. Hence safety of \noperation of these mechanized and non-mechanized boats should be given special \nemphasis. Perhaps Panchayat should be given more roles in regulating the country \nboats. For this it is necessary to empower the Panchayats under specific rules/ \nregulation Panchayats should also be provided specific funds for such regulation.\n4.7.3 \nTill a full-fledged department is set up in the states for IWT operation, it is proposed \nthat every district transport departments/offices should have a few staff and officers \nspecially for handling matters related to non-mechanically propelled inland vessels.  \nThese staff may be trained in handling matters related to non-mechanically propelled \ninland vessels. Such officer can in turn train Panchayats officials in handling matters \nrelated to non-mechanized country boats.   \n4.7.4 \nSuitable Government departments with qualified personnel, such as Inland Water \nTransport department, ports and harbors department, captain of ports etc. should \nbe made responsible for framing and implementation of rules and regulations. The \nGovernments may also use the services of their Maritime Boards, (wherever available) \nfor this purpose.\n4.7.5 \nIt is recommended that all States having river transport should set up an Inland \nWater transport Department if not already done. This department should be made \nresponsible for development and implementation of boat safety regulation.\n4.7.6 \nGovernment may also authorize Classification societies like IRS for specific certification \npurposes, as is done by DG Shipping for seagoing vessels. Rules of state governments \nalready rely upon classification Society requirements for construction aspects.\n\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n39\n5.1 \nOverview\n5.1.1 \nThe search operations in the aftermath of accidents in waterways is of paramount \nimportance. Experience has shown that the local community in the vicinity of any \naccident including the Inland Water Transport are, ipso-facto, the first responders \nattending to a considerable part of the rescue operations before intervention by the \nspecialized ‘Search & Rescue’ teams of the state machinery. Accordingly, initial focus \nhas to be to dwell upon the advance action in terms of infrastructure arrangements \nwhich would expedite the rescue operations. This would, inter-alia, entail training and \nstrengthening the capacity of the under mentioned front-line manpower/groups on \nadvance ‘rescue techniques’ -\n \na) \nBoat Crew and the skill- personal staff available at all entry points.\n \nb) \nCommunity groups living along the river bed.  \n \nc) \nPolice personnel/law and order machinery stationed along the river-bank and \n \nd) \nRegistered local Self Help Groups (SHGs)-in the nearby Village clusters, to start \nwith.\n \nAt the time of any tragedy, with the support of local volunteer teams, as above, the \nState SDRF (supported by NDRF Battalion personnel, if/wherever necessary,) would \nbe in charge of rescue operations gainfully assisted by the local authorities in the \nsearch & rescue operation.\n5.2 \nCurrent Practices\n5.2.1 \nAgencies like Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI), State IWT, SDMA SDRF, \nRiverine Police, Local administration and local bodies like Ghat Union of Boat drivers \netc. are involved in advising/subscribing to the smooth operation of boats and \nvessels. However, no single agency performs as nodal agency for the matters related \nto   search and rescue. There is no separate wing/setup in Inland Water Transport \nSearch and Rescue\n5\n\n40\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nNatioNal Disaster MaNageMeNt guiDeliNes : Boat safety\n(IWT), to deal with the emergencies and no special course/training is being imparted \nto the employees of IWT.  The Riverine Police performs only Police duties to maintain \nlaw and orders along the ferry ghats and does not have any search and rescue wing \nand specialized training or equipments for the purpose. In essence an institutional \nset-up would be required to coordinate the hazard mitigation activity, in all its facets \nthat is from ‘regulation’ to ‘rescue-operation’ including an organized mechanism \nfor emergency management and distress response on a regular basis. Thus there \nis a need to adopt training interventions on search and rescue. The primary goal of \ntraining in search and rescue operations would be to set up ‘Trained and equipped \nvolunteer Teams’ consisting of local people will be set up, over a period, in the area, \nwhere Passenger  Boats are frequently used, as means of ‘front-line’ force  to respond \nquickly and effectively  to any tragic and emergency event’. \n5.2.2 \nQuick Reaction Teams\n \nWell trained and equipped Quick Reaction Teams of local trained volunteers, Police, \nHome Guard/SDRF should be placed at pre-designated Ferry Ghat or docking points \nso as to carry out quick & effective rescue operations.\n5.2.3 \nMock Drills \n \nThere should be regular mock drills and table top exercises of all the stakeholders \nin the States & Districts.  This will help in refreshing the training, as well as help to \nget to know the gaps & the lesson learnt for future sake.  This will also enhance the \ncoordination among various agencies and the stakeholders to deal with search and \nrescue practices.\n5.3 \nStandard Operating Procedures (SOPs)\nResponsibility of each stakeholder/ establishment needs to be fixed well in advance in form of \nStandard Operating Procedure. In addition other important issues that need to be considered \nfor the development of rescue plan during boat tragedy are listed as under:-\n \n \nDepartment specific customized action plan to save life including quick response \nto any eventuality/emergency/ distress call. \n \n \nPreparedness plan of all the stakeholders involved in rescue operations, evaluate \nstakeholders competency, test the established emergency operation procedures.\n \n \nOnline inventory of emergency, rescue & relief equipment/ resources with \nlocal authorities, public and corporate institutions for possible accessing during \nemergency.\n\nSearch and reScue\n41\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n \n \nCoordinated emergency rescue plan, institutional mechanism and triggering \naction with joint partnership of locals, Police Stations, local Municipal/ \nPanchayati Raj Institution/District/State level involving all concerned agencies \nincluding Armed Forces/Para-Military Forces, Police/Coastal Police/Water Police, \nNDRF/SDRF/, Civil Defence, Home Guard etc.\n5.4 \nAccident Management Plan\nBoat Accident Management Plan prepared by all agencies such as local Boat operators, Ghat \nOwners, Panchayat Raj Institutions, Block, District& State will incorporate detail guidelines \nfor prioritizing implementation of rescue activities depending on magnitude and severity of \nboat tragedy.  Response component of plan will involve rapid deployment of Search & Rescue \nTeams.  The Plan should prescribe appropriate coordination mechanism with other agency/\nstakeholders working in area.\n5.5 \nEmergency Search & Rescue \nThe local communities residing at bank of rivers/sea or fishermen in River/Sea are always the \nfirst responder after any waterways tragedy. The past experience has shown that 80 percent \nof search and rescue operations are carried out by local communities before the intervention \nof any local/state machinery and specialized search & rescue teams.  Trained and equipped \nvolunteer teams consisting of local people should be constituted in the area where boats \nare frequently used as means of communication and transportation to respond quickly and \neffectively at the time of such tragedy. \n5.5.1 \nSearch & Rescue Teams\n \nIn order to strengthen search and rescue capabilities at the community level, each of \nthe river channels /waterways should have local community level with basic trainings \nin search & rescue operations. Wharfs /Docks should invariably have rescue teams \nreadily available with necessary rescue equipment for quick response of life saving. \nTraining on search & rescue should be imparted for the community along with ghat \nlevel search and rescue trainings, either through SDRF/NDRF or through any competent \nauthority dealing with navigation rescue. Besides, the specialized teams SDRF and \nNDRF should also assist the local authorities in search & rescue operations.\n\n42\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nNatioNal Disaster MaNageMeNt guiDeliNes : Boat safety\n5.6 \nResponse Mechanism at Boats/Vessels\n5.6.1 \nSkill Development of Crew Members and Passengers \n \nThe crew members should be skilled in handling all kinds of emergency situations \nbesides their routine duties on board. It may be made mandatory for boat operators \n/other staffs to undergo training in water rescue and other distress response skills \nbefore undertaking jobs of boat handling. It should also be made mandatory for crew \nmembers to brief passengers on board about all safety provisions and Do’s and Don’ts \nand essential life saving techniques with all other measures to be followed in case of \naccidents in boats /ferries.\n5.6.2 \nSecurity Audit of Boats/Vessels\n \nSecurity Audit of boats/vessels on regular basis should be made as mandatory \nprovisions for all mechanized and non mechanized boat operations. It is, therefore, \nrecommended that security audits on weekly, monthly, quarterly, half-yearly and \nannual basis for safety aspect of vessel/boat, safety audit of rescue equipment, medical \nequipment and communication equipment  should be done as per requirements. \nThere may be provision for regular mock drills and exercises of all the crew members \nincluding lifeguards/medical teams/communication team and so on. It is also \nrecommended to conduct refresher training courses on disaster management for \nthe entire crew members along with mental, physical and medical health check up \non regular intervals. \n5.6.3 \nResponse Mechanism at Wharfs/Ferry Ghats \n \nIn order to ensure the rapid response mechanism at the wharf level, a dedicated \nintegrated control room should be established to supervise and oversee the normal \ntraffic, monitor and to alert all concerned in case of accidents. The Integrated Control \nRoom must be in communication with all the boats/vessels operating in the area, \nnearby adjacent Ghats, QRTs as well as other sister/responding agencies that is River \nPolice, Police, SDRF, Circle/block office etc. The Wharfs should have close circuit camera \nsystem at the approaches, boarding points and other strategic points to monitor the \nroutine traffic to avoid accidents and other hazardous/ threatening activities. The \nintegrated control room should be able to monitor and use integrated GPS system \nfor smooth movement of boats/vessels and track boats in case of accidents and \nemergency. The personnel in the Control Room must be proficient in handling all the \nequipment. There should be the provision of maintenance staff to ensure that all the \nequipments are functional round the clock. The Control Room must work round the \nclock on 24x7 basis specially at places where boats operate during nights.\n\nSearch and reScue\n43\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n5.6.4 \nRapid Action Teams/Quick Response Teams (QRT)\n \nIn all navigable waterways, wharfs (ghats) should be equipped with Quick Response \nTeams (QRT) to deal with the possible emergent situations. The size of QRT and the \nnumber of boats may depend upon the vulnerability, traffic of the ghats and navigation \nchannels. The team must be in standby position to be able to react on a short notice \nround the clock. There should be provision of deep water divers in a group of three \npersonnel while responding to the emergent situation. The regular staff appointed \nto manage the ghat administration may double up as QRT to garner the strength. It \nis, thus, recommended to impart trainings to QRT personnel for water rescue. They \nmust take active participation at regular intervals and regular mock drills must be \nconducted with all the responding agencies and stakeholders. The deep divers in QRT \nmust be able to track live victims and evacuate the victims from murky water and able \nto use cutting tools to rescue victims from the drowned structure of boats/vessels.\n5.7 \nRescue Equipments at Ghats \nAll the Quick Response Teams (QRTs) must be equipped with high-speed rescue boats having \nsufficient capacity to accommodate victims and rescuers. The rescue boat must have medical \nfirst response kits, life saving medicines and stretchers for carrying victims. It is also essential \nto have provisions for heavy duty  \nrecovery/dredgers and towboats to rescue and salvage \nboats/vessels. In addition, tools and equipment to cut the underwater iron and wooden \nstructure of boat/vessel or any object of hindrance should also be stored.\n5.8 \nMedical Support\nAll the wharfs dealing with passenger traffics must have well maintained and equipped medical \nroom with trained staff including doctors and paramedics. The Medical Room must have all \nthe necessary life saving drugs and medicines and emergency automated CPR system. There \nshould be adequate provision for ambulances and boat ambulances for quick evacuation to \npre-identified and coordinated higher medical care centers. They may be activated during traffic \nhours in the water channel or these can be kept ready for unforeseen situations. Adequate \nstock of life saving medicines must be stored on board the boat ambulances.  \n5.9 \nState Disaster Response Force (SDRF)\n5.9.1 \nThe activation of State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) must be ensured when the \nresponse teams at Wharfs/Block/Circle and district level have failed to effectively respond \nto boat accidents or when the authorities feel the existing response mechanism will not be \n\n44\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nNatioNal Disaster MaNageMeNt guiDeliNes : Boat safety\nable to respond to the boat/vessel accidents or when the emergency requires the prompt \nintervention of State machinery. SDRF must be developed and equipped as per the standard \nstructure of National Disaster Response Force to effectively respond to such disaster.  All water \nrescue equipment like Stanley under water cutter/under water plasma cutting machines/under \nwater chain  saw/under water search camera and torch/gas cutting torches/gas cutter/under \nwater welding pro to tackle level-2 disaster must be available. Trainings must be imparted to \nSDRF battalions to tackle boat/vessel accidents in addition to other kinds of disasters. It is also \nessential that standard activation signals of alertness and mobilization should be followed by \nall responders, so that team may be mobilized immediately after getting signals . SDRF should \nhave the capability in terms of man material and training for better response with precision and \nefficiency. A Control Room of SDRF is recommended to be integrated with State EOCs/District \nEOCs/NDRF/ River Police/local Police/ other responding agencies and stakeholders which have \nbeen identified and coordinated by the state for inland water rescue emergencies. SDRF must \ntake part at District/State level mock drills and exercises. To save the precious response time \n, some of the fully equipped SDRF teams must be prepositioned at vital locations/launching \nbases at vulnerable wharfs .The whole response mechanism of District/State level should \nbe integrated with SDRF so that the resource requirements at the site of operation could be \nrapidly filled to evacuate victims.\n5.10 \nNational Disaster Response Force\nThe activation of NDRF should be ensured when the response teams at State level failed to \neffectively respond to boat accidents or when the state authorities feel the existing state \nresponse mechanism will not be able to respond to the boat/vessel accidents or when the \nemergency requires the prompt intervention of national response machinery.\n\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n45\n6.1 \nOverview\nCapacity Building   and Training (CBT) in developmental context aims at reduction in the \nstratification  in terms of Knowledge gaps and thus promotes empowerment. The capacity \ndevelopment interventions for safe waterways management and passenger boat travel and \nnavigation aims at adoption of modern standards in travel arrangements, which ultimately lead \nto self regulations by crew members, boat management authorities and on board passengers.  \nFor this purpose,   it is expected by the state governments to facilitate promoting awareness \nin the form of Capacity Building and Training modules on safety infrastructure covering \nmanagement of standards of boat-design and operation for safe travel, conveniences in ghat \ninfrastructure for safe on and off loading of passenger and crew, advance facilitations for quick \nrescue operations at the point of risks and above all spread of ‘safety education’ among the \nstakeholders.\n6.1.1 \nCapacity Building , as an activity, would have to  provide  emphasis, inter-alia, (i) \nto  adopt modern standards of  training and certification for crew members; (ii) \nenforcement of effective safety standards for boats/ vessels and their crew members \n; and (iii) placing of competent enforcement regimes at both the state / district/ \nPanchayat  level. Thus, the ultimate goal of  ‘Capacity Building’ would be to ensure \nthat ferry safety and preparedness efforts across the country would lead to better \nregulations of safe navigation and ferry operations in waterways , and to ensure \nnecessary safety and rescue equipment in place. In pursuing these targets, attention \nneeds to be paid to the following mandatory and enabling aspects:\n \n• \nIdentification of capacity gaps and enabling environment to fill the gaps  \n \n• \nMinimum and mandatory requirement of infrastructures and tools required for \nbridging the gaps \n \n• \nFramework for capacity development, training and other structured programmes \non safety and  awareness \nCapacity Development\n6\n\n46\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nNatioNal Disaster MaNageMeNt guiDeliNes : Boat safety\n \n• \nRegulatory Do’s and Dont’s\n \n• \nActive involvement of stakeholders like SDRF, Local Police, Village Administration, \nBoat-Owners’ Associations etc. and other structural orientations \n \n• \nThe infrastructure requirements for capacity development, in all its forms,  be \nidentified. \n \n• \nA specific module on ‘Search and Rescue’ for crew members be incorporated \nin the existing training modules.\n \n• \nInvolvement of SDMA/SDRF in the implementation of capacity building and \ntraining. \n6.2 \nFramework of Capacity Development\nWhile acknowledging and recognizing the importance of boat accidents, it is important to \ninvite attention of the stakeholders (governments, ship owners/operators, training providers, \nBoat industry associations, shipbuilders/repairers, etc.) to take actions as follows: \n\t\n \nUrge the periodic review and continued development and improvement of \nrelevant guidelines on surveying, training, legislation and regulations, and \ndomestic ship safety programmes, including adequate training, accreditation \nand regulation of surveyors to meet standards set by all the states dealing with \nriverine water transport.\n\t\n \nAdoption of synergy between maritime administrations in order to promote \ncooperation for accident investigation.\n\t\n \nTraining and capacity building of stakeholders to develop infrastructures in the \nareas of docking, slipping and passenger terminals. \n\t\n \nTraining and Mock Drills of crew members and boat operators.\n\t\n \nCampaign through Information Education and Communication (IEC) materials, \nposters , Handouts etc.\n\t\n \nSafety education, campaigns on boat design and operations, wharf management \nstrategies, search and rescue education and regulatory mechanisms.\n\t\n \nThe target groups for CBT include boat operators, Boat men, crew members, \nWharf Managers besides the community groups living along the river bed.\n\t\n \nPolice personnel/law and order machinery stationed along the river-bank and \nregistered local Self Help Groups (SHGs) in the nearby Village clusters.\n\nCapaCity Development\n47\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n6.3 \nInternational Practices \n6.5.1 \nPassenger boat travel by means of ferries has been accounted as comparatively safer \ntransportation medium in developed countries. In United States, ferries reportedly \noperate in 40 states with strict adherence to laid down procedures, including safety \nstandards, by the local and federal governments. These regulations are periodically \nupdated based on operational experience. The city of Seattle, which has the largest \nUS ferry system, claims a ferry travel density of approximately 26 million passengers \neach year. The Ferry system in developing countries, on the other hand encounter \ncontinued problems of understaffing, severe overcrowding, aging vessels, and the \nlack of regulatory standards. As a result of this , frequency of  accidents in rivers and \nports, with the same ferry operators become a common spectacle. In Somalia and \nBangladesh, for example, ferry accidents are regular phenomena. In Bangladesh, \nabout 1,000 people die in every in year ferry accidents.\n6.4 \nIdentification of Methods and Target Groups\n6.4.1 \nCapacity Building through Campaign –\n \nThe capacity building through campaigns may result in the capacity generation at \nvarious levels in a multi dimensional way. The under mentioned table gives account \nof campaigns which may result in capacity development-\nName of the campaign\nWho will conduct\nWhat knowledge will \nbe Delivered\nOutput Capacity\nBoat Insurance\n(like fire insurance; \nmachine breakdown \ninsurance; motor \ninsurance; burglary \ninsurance etc)\nInsurance \nInformation (about \ntype of insurance, \ninterest rate)and laws \nthat are needed to be \nfollowed for provision \nof insurance in order \nto minimise the risk of \nboat owners (loss from \naccidents, capsizing \netc)\nRisk reduction towards \nloss , awareness \ntowards (importance \nof safety measures), \nensure safety of people\n\n48\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nNatioNal Disaster MaNageMeNt guiDeliNes : Boat safety\nName of the campaign\nWho will conduct\nWhat knowledge will \nbe Delivered\nOutput Capacity\nTraditional Knowledge\nOld and experienced \npeople from the \ncommunity (old and \nexperienced drivers \nand boat operators)\nAbout boating in \nvarious conditions \n(movement of the \nwinds & the waves) \nand understanding the \nenvironment (nature of \nthe river, weather)\nHow to handle \nthe emergency \nsituation(boat \ncapsizing, accident, \ncyclone) in \nabsence of basic \nequipments(safety \nkit, first aid kit, \ncommunication device \nlike radio and GPS, \nropes and inflated \ntyres.)\nAlcohol Consumption\nHealth care \ninstitutions, NGOs, \nmedia( hospitals, \nrehabilitation centres)\nHow alcohol can cause \naccidents on boat.

The prospective institutions \nmay be identified by State Disaster Management Authorities in consultation with \nNational Institute of Disaster Management.  \n6.5 \nConclusion\nCapacity Building and Training (CBT) is a continuous and integrated process of safe boat \noperations in the inland waterways. As the target groups suffer from serious knowledge \ngaps and cultural diversities, the role of CBT becomes more important. Passenger safety is a \nfunction of regulation and regulatory enforcements that ipso facto requires the support of CBT \nprogrammes for eliciting the cooperation of target groups. Thus the success of CBT rests on the \norganizational and functional support from the state governments and concerned stakeholders \n\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n51\nDO’s and DONT’S for Boat Safety\nDo’s  for Boatmen and Boat Drivers\nDon’ts for Boatmen and Boat Drivers\n\nCarry flotation devices \n\nDon’t drink and drive\n\nCarry life jackets\n\nDon’t travel at high speed\n\nCommunicate with passengers about \nsafety measures\n\nDon’t carry passengers more than the \napproved capacity of the boat\n\nProper maintenance of boat\n\nDon’t use boat in stormy condition\n\nCarry distress signal devices\n\nCarry communication devices\n\nKeep good look out for other boats and \nswimmers when in water\n\nStore flammable item in a safe place \n\nCarry fire extinguisher in a designated \nplace \nDo’s  for Passengers\nDon’ts for Passengers\n\nListen to the crew\n\nDon’t rush into a boat\n\nFollow the rules\n\nDon’t fight on board\n\nMaintain the cleanliness of the site\n\nDon’t stand and change seat in small \nboat when it is full\n\nDo not cross the designated zone on \nthe site\n\nDo not disturb the crew while they are \noperating\nDO’s and DONT’S  \nfor Boat Safety\n7\n\n52\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nNatioNal Disaster MaNageMeNt guiDeliNes : Boat safety\nDo’s  for Boat operator\nDon’ts for Boat operator\n\nEnsure the certificate of survey and \nlicence onboard when the boat is in use\n\nDo not allow any explosive and hazardous \nmaterial onboard\n\nEnsure the crew is enough and sufficient \nto handle the passengers\n\nDo not allow over loading\n\nEnsure that right information is circulated \nonboard\n\nDon not allow any unauthorised \nalteration on boat\n\nEnsure that boat is equipped and crew \nis trained to handle fire and rescue \npassengers\n\nDo not allow unauthorised person to \nget on board\n\nEnsure that the boat is insured for third \npart risks\n\nEnsure the boat is clean and dry while \noperating\n\nEnsure proper communication \nmechanism exist before the boat starts \noperating\n\n53\nAnnexures\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nAnnexure: 1\n\n54\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nNatioNal Disaster MaNageMeNt guiDeliNes : Boat safety\n\n55\nAnnexures\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n\n56\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nNatioNal Disaster MaNageMeNt guiDeliNes : Boat safety\n\n57\nAnnexures\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n\n58\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nNatioNal Disaster MaNageMeNt guiDeliNes : Boat safety\n\n59\nAnnexures\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n\n60\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nNatioNal Disaster MaNageMeNt guiDeliNes : Boat safety\n\n61\nAnnexures\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n\n62\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nNatioNal Disaster MaNageMeNt guiDeliNes : Boat safety\n\n63\nAnnexures\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n\n64\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nNatioNal Disaster MaNageMeNt guiDeliNes : Boat safety\n\n65\nAnnexures\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n\n66\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nNatioNal Disaster MaNageMeNt guiDeliNes : Boat safety\n\n67\nAnnexures\nNational Disaster Management Authority\n\n69\nAnnexures\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nAnnexure: 2\n\n70\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nNatioNal Disaster MaNageMeNt guiDeliNes : Boat safety\nAnnexure: 3\n\n71\nAnnexures\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nAnnexure: 4\n\nContact Us\nFor further information on Guidelines\tfor\tBoat\tSafety,\nPlease Contact:\nNational Disaster Management Authority\nGovernment of India\nNDMA Bhawan, \nA-1 Safdarjung Enclave, \nNew Delhi-110 029 \nEmail: mitigation@ndma.gov.in\nTel:  +91-11-26701700\nWeb: www.ndma.gov.in"

The Guidelines focus upon the urgent need to strengthen risk resilience of schools \nin rural as well as urban areas of the country. It is hoped that this document will be useful to ensure \nthat all school children across the country remain safe from any kind of disaster risk as they access \ntheir right to education.\n \nThe Guidelines highlight upon the following key elements:\n● \nAddresses the vertical of school safety in a more inclusive and holistic manner in the \nnational policy sphere\n● \nCapacity building of children, teachers, school personnel, state and district education \nmachinery on school safety and disaster preparedness\n● \nAnchoring /implementing child centered community based disaster risk reduction in \nthe local context \n● \nMainstreaming risk and safety education in the school curriculum.\n● \nLinking school safety in the existing government schemes and policies.\n● \nStrengthening coordination amongst institutional structures at the district, state, and \nnational levels to promote effective child rights governance in disaster situations\n \nChapter 1 introduces the concept and examines the importance on school safety as placed \nin the various national policies and guidelines.\n \nChapter 2 details the key challenges faced while addressing safety issues in schools, the \ncore principles of school safety which have been kept in mind while formulating the said guidelines \nand the vision and objectives of the guidelines.\n \nChapter 3 details the various activities that need to be undertaken at the state, district \nand local levels to be able to address school safety in a holistic manner. This includes, school safety \nplanning at designated levels, preparation of school disaster management plans, implementation \nof safety actions (structural and non –structural measures, capacity building of stakeholders, \nincorporation of school safety and disaster preparedness in core curriculum, monitoring of risk and \nmainstreaming of disaster risk reduction in all the school education initiatives.\n \nChapter 4 details the roles and responsibilities of the various stakeholders to ensure \nschool safety at national, state and local levels.\n \nChapter 5 highlights specific actions towards school safety that can be undertaken by \ndifferent stakeholders within the existing framework for delivery of education.\nExecutive Summary\n\n\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nSection 1\nIntroduction\nContent\n1.1\nDisasters as a critical threat to the well-being of \nchildren\n3\n1.2\nUnderstanding  School Safety\n3\n1.3\nNational Policy Instruments\n4\n1.4\nScope of the Guidelines\n4\n\n\n3\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\n1.1 \nDisasters as a critical threat to \nthe well-being of children\n'Disasters’, are defined as “a serious disruption \nof the functioning of a community or a society \ncausing widespread human, material, economic \nor environmental losses which exceed the ability \nof the affected community or society to cope \nusing its own resources”1. Due to a range of \nfactors, including age, physical ability, gender, \nhealth conditions and, dependency on care \ngivers, many children are extremely vulnerable \nin the event of a disaster. Such events cause \na serious disruption in their healthy growth \nand development as well as overall well-being. \nExperiences of fear, violence, separation from \nparents and caregivers, exploitation and abuse, \nare some of the key risks that children face. \nMoreover, the loss of livelihood of their families \ncan lead to homelessness and extreme poverty. \nAs with other infrastructure, schools are also \nexposed to disaster risk. Disasters have not \nonly challenged the government and other \nstakeholders in providing access to education but \nalso endangered the lives of children and those \nengaged in the pursuit of education.\nThere is enough evidence to reflect that the \nquality of school premises and existing capacities \nof the stakeholders have a bearing on a child’s \nvulnerability to disaster risks. Annexure 1 \nprovides details on the number of lives lost and \nthe extent of damage to school premises in some \nof the major disasters globally and nationally.\nGiven the fact that children are expected to spend \nmajority of their time at school, safe schools \nattain very high importance with a view to \nensuring their safety and well being. Schools can \nbe a safe haven for children that help them slowly \nmove back to normalcy. Within the safe school \npremises, essential supplementary nutrition for \nchildren can be provided, along with safe water \nand sanitation facilities especially for adolescent \ngirls and boys. Thus there is a global consensus \nthat schools should be resumed at the earliest in \nthe aftermath of a disaster \n1.2  \nUnderstanding School Safety\n‘School Safety’ has been defined as the creation \nof safe environments for children starting from \ntheir homes to their schools and back. This \nincludes safety from large-scale 'natural' hazards \nof geological/climatic origin, human-made risks, \npandemics, violence as well as more frequent \nand smaller-scale fires, transportation and other \nrelated emergencies, and environmental threats \nthat can adversely affect the lives of children.2 \nThe concept has evolved over the last couple of \ndecades as the threat to the physical well being \nof children has become more visible both globally \nand in the country. \nThe Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) \n2005-2015; building the Resilience of Nations \nand Communities to Disasters, adopted at \nthe World Conference on Disaster Reduction \nunderlines the importance of knowledge and \neducation as one of its five main priorities. It \ndraws attention to school children and youth \nwith the aim of making the community at large \nmore aware of the threat of hazards and become \nbetter prepared.\nThe concept of school safety in its current \nform includes safety issues both inside and \noutside the school. It includes issues of child \nprotection and safety that look at all forms of \nviolence and deprivation that affect the physical \nand mental wellbeing of children. As it stands \ntoday therefore, School Safety is a concept \nIntroduction\n1\n1. http://www.unisdr.org/eng/library/lib-terminology-\neng%20home.htm on 13 October 2013.\n2.

      "faqs-dmplan.pdf": "Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) from Ministries on Disaster Management \nPlan: \nSl. \nNo. \nFrequently Asked Questions Answers \n1 \nWhat is a Disaster \nManagement Plan in the \ncontext of a Ministry / \nDepartment? Why should \nour Ministry / Department \nprepare DM Plan? \nA Disaster Management Plan of a Ministry / \nDepartment is a comprehensive plan \ncovering all the 4 phases of disaster \nmanagement cycle such as prevention, \nmitigation, preparedness, response (search \n& rescue, relief and reconstruction), which \nwill spell out the actions to be taken by the \nMinistry / Department. It has been clearly \nstates in the Disaster Management Act, \n2005. \n \nAs per Section 37 of the DM Act 2005  \n(1) Every Ministry or Department of \nGovernment of India shall –  \n• (a) prepare a disaster management \nplan specifying the following \nparticulars, namely:- \n– (i) the measures to be taken \nby it for prevention and \nmitigation of disasters in \naccordance with the National \nPlan; \n– (ii) the specifications regarding \nintegration of mitigation \nmeasures in its development \nplans in accordance with the \nguidelines of the National \nAuthority and the National \n\nExecutive Committee; \n– (iii) its roles and \nresponsibilities in relation to \npreparedness and capacity \nbuilding to deal with any \nthreatening disaster situation \nor disaster; \n– (iv) its roles and \nresponsibilities in regard to \npromptly and effectively \nresponding to any threatening \ndisaster situation or disaster; \n– (v) the present status of its \npreparedness to perform the \nroles and responsibilities \nspecified in cub-clauses (iii) \nand (iv); \n– (vi) the measures required to \nbe taken in order to enable it \nto perform its responsibilities \nspecified in sub-clauses (iii) \nand (iv);  \n2 \nIs it mandatory to have a \nDM Plan by a Ministry / \nDepartment? What is the \nlegal provision? \nYes, As per sec – 37 (1) (a) of DM Act, 2005, \nevery Ministry or Department of the \nGovernment of India shall prepare a Disaster \nManagement Plan \n3 \nWhich Ministry / \nDepartment is required to \nmake Disaster Management \nPlans? \nAs per sec – 37 (1) (a) of DM Act, 2005, \nevery Ministry or Department of the \nGovernment of India shall prepare a Disaster \nManagement Plan \n4 \nWhat is the role of nodal \nIn addition to their Departmental DM Plan, \n\nMinistries? What sort of \nplan should they prepare? \nthey have to develop a Plan to address how \nto deal with disaster for which it is \ndesignated as nodal Ministry and prepare a \nholistic plan for that particular \ndisaster/disasters. \n5 \nWho will approve the plans \nprepared by Ministries / \nDepartments? \nAs per sec – 37 (1) (c) of DM Act, 2005, every \nMinistry / Department of the Government of \nIndia shall forward a copy of its Disaster \nManagement Plan to NDMA for its approval \n6 \nWho will approve DM Plan \nof offices and units under \nthe control of a Ministry / \nDepartment? \nThe DM Plans of the offices and units under \nthe control of a Ministry / Department shall \nbe approved by respective Ministry \n/Department, by ensuring that it is in \nconsonance with the Disaster Management \nPlan of the concerned Ministry. \n7 \nHow to have horizontal and \nvertical linkage with the plan \nof other Ministries / State \nGovernments?  \n \nDisaster Management is a multi-\ndimensional, multi-level and multi-\nstakeholder issue and hence it would \nrequire horizontal and vertical linkages with \nall concerned stakeholders and also \ncoordination with state governments for \neffective implementation of the plan. \nHorizontal linkage implies linkages with \nother Ministries and Departments of \nGovernment of India or with other agencies \nfor early warning, response etc. Vertical \nlinkage is meant to have up and down \nlinkages with concerned \nMinistries/Departments/Agencies. The \nMinistries/Departments should also have \nlinkages with concerned departments in the \nState Government as well as their own \noffices/units/PSUs in States and Districts for \nthe purpose of effective disaster \nmanagement. \n8 \nHow should Plan \nimplementation be \nThe Act mandates that every Ministry and \nDepartment of the Government of India and \n\nmonitored? \nevery state must prepare a DMP in \naccordance with the NDMP. Respective DM \nauthorities must regularly review and \nupdate their DM plans. Central ministries \nand state governments will integrate DRR \ninto their development policy, planning and \nprogramming at all levels. They must adopt \na holistic approach and build multi-\nstakeholder partnerships at all levels, as \nappropriate, for the implementation of the \nDM plans. Depending on its nature, different \ncomponents of the NDMP will be \nimplemented within short, medium and \nlong-term timeframes ending in 2030, with \nthe actions under these timeframes often \nrunning concurrently and not sequentially. \nIn a broad sense, the approach described in \nthe NDMP applies to all those working for \ndisaster risk reduction in the country, \nincluding Ministries / Departments.  \n \n(for more details refer to section 1.15 of \nNDMP 2019) \n9 \nWhose responsibility is it to \nmonitor the implementation \nof the Plan from Central \nGovernment? \nAs per Section 37 (2) (b) Every Ministry or \nDepartment of the Government of India \nfurnish a status report regarding the \nimplementation of the plan referred to in \nclause (a) of sub-section (1) to the National \nAuthority as and when required by it. \n \nAbove all Central Government Ministries / \nDepartments is the National Executive \nCommittee, which shall monitor the \nimplementation of the National Plan and the \nplans prepared by the Ministries or \nDepartments of the Government of India. \n10 \nHow often the Plan be \nAs per sec – 37 (1) (b) of DM Act, 2005, \n\nrevised? \nevery Ministry / Department of the \nGovernment of India shall review and \nupdate its Disaster Management Plan \nannually. \n11 \nIn cases where Ministry \nbuilding is maintained by \nCPWD and they take care of \nthe building, is it required \nfor Ministry / Department to \nhave a DMP in such cases? \nYes, the DM Plan is not just about the \nstructural safety of the building. The DM \nPlan of a Ministry/Department should \ninclude safety of people, property and \ninformation and also to ensure business \ncontinuity during a disaster. The preparation \nof the DM Plan can be undertaken based on \nthe functions of the Ministry / Department \nand roles and responsibilities assigned to it \nas per the provisions of the Act, NDMP 2019 \nand different national guidelines brought \nout by NDMA. \n12 \nIf a Ministry deals with \nissues not directly related to \ndisaster management, e.g. \npersonnel issues (pension \nmatters etc.), then in such \ncases is it required for \nMinistry / Department to \nhave a DMP? \nYes, the DM Plan of a Ministry/Department \nshould include safety of people, property \nand information and also to ensure business \ncontinuity during a disaster. Based on the \nfunctions of the department, it can go for \nmainstreaming of disaster risk reduction in \nits programmes, plans and policies. \n13 \nIs Crisis Management Plan \nsame as DMP? Should a \nseparate Crisis Management \nPlan and a Disaster \nManagement Plan be \nprepared? What is the \nrationale? \nNo. Crisis management plan is a plan for \nresponding to an identified crisis and its \nplans how to manage a crisis when it occurs, \nwhereas a Disaster Management Plan \nincludes gamut of activities as per the DM \nAct, the NDMP and various national \nguidelines issued by NDMA. Crisis \nManagement Plan basically deals with \nresponse, whereas Disaster Management \nPlan is a holistic one including preventive \nstrategies. \n14 \nIs Safety Plan same as DMP? No. Safety Plan addresses only one aspect of \nsafety from a particular disaster, which is a \n\npre-disaster preparedness. Disaster \nManagement Plan deals with all disasters in \nall phases of disaster management cycle. \n15 \nDo sensitive / high security \nMinistries also need a DMP? \nWhat issues need to be \naddressed? E.g. Ministry of \nParliamentary Affairs, \nDefence Ministry etc \nYes, As per the DM Act, every \nMinistry/Department shall prepare its DM \nPlan. Sensitive / High Security Ministries may \nnot display the Plan on public domain. \n16 \nIf the Rules of Business don’t \nmandate for any disaster \nrelated intervention, then in \nsuch cases, is Ministry / \nDepartment required to \nprepare DMP? \nIt should be noted that the Allocation of \nBusiness (Rules), 1961 indicate which \nsubjects are to be dealt with by which \nMinistry / Department. Preparation of \nDisaster Management Plan of Ministry / \nDepartment is a statutory duty of the \nMinistry / Department as mandated by the \nDisaster Management Act, 2005. Therefore, \nthe first step in preparation of the Disaster \nManagement Plan of the Ministry / \nDepartment can be to scruitinise all the \nfunctions allocated to it by the GoI (AoB) \nRules, 1961. Therefore, there is no conflict. \n17 \nIf a Ministry / Department is \nnot involved in \ndevelopment/ infrastructure \nrelated schemes/ \nprogrammes, then in such \ncases, is Ministry / \nDepartment required to \nprepare DMP? \nYes, the Disaster Management Plan should \nbe prepared on the basis of the functions of \nthe Ministry / Department and roles and \nresponsibilities assigned to it, as per the \nprovisions of the Act, NDMP 2019 and \ndifferent national guidelines brought out by \nNDMA. \n18 \nWhat are the financial \nimplications of a DM Plan? \nWhere from funds can be \narranged for programmes \nand activities provided in a \nDMP? \nA plan and disaster management cannot be \nsuccessful without suitable budgetary \nprovisions. Budgetary provisions should be \nmade for different activities and for \ndifferent phases of disaster management. \nWhile mainstreaming DRR in the plans and \nprogrammes of the Ministry/Department, \n\nappropriate financial provisions should be \nmade. In order to develop resilience in \nprojects and programmes, additional \nbudgetary provisions may be required. \n \nAs per Section 36 (d) of the DM Act, it shall \nbe the responsibility of every Ministry or \nDepartment of the Government of India to \nallocate funds for measures for prevention \nof disaster, mitigation, capacity building and \npreparedness. As per Section 37 (2) (a) - \nEvery Ministry or Department of the \nGovernment of India shall make, while \npreparing disaster management plan under \nclause (a) of sub-section (1), provisions for \nfinancing the activities specified therein. \n19 \nWhat are basic components \nof a DMP? How to develop \nDMP? \nThe Disaster Management Plan of a Ministry \n/ Department should be prepared in two \nparts. Part-I National Component / Part-II \nContingency Plan for the Ministry/Dept. \n \nPart – I should include – Preliminaries, \nHazard, Risk, Vulnerability and Capacity \nAnalysis (HRVCA), Hazard Specific \nPrevention and Mitigation Measures, \nMainstreaming. Inclusiveness, Coherence of \nDisaster Risk Management across Resilient \nDevelopment and Climate Change Action, \nCapacity Development and Communication, \nCoordination – Horizontal and Vertical \nLinkages, Preparedness and Response, \nRecovery and Reconstructions, Budgetary \nProvisions and Plan Management etc. \n \nPart – II is about Ministry’s / Department’s \nown Disaster Management Plan comprising \nof Institutional Arrangements for Response/ \n\nIncident Command System, Prevention and \nMitigation of Disasters, Preparedness, \nMitigation, Ensuring Business Continuity of \nthe Ministry/ Dept., Monitoring, Recovery \netc. \n \n(For more details, please refer to the \ntemplate for preparation of DM Plan by \nMinistry / Department, shared by NDMA) \n20 \nWhat expertise is needed for \npreparation of DMP? \nThe person / team responsible for \ndevelopment of Disaster Management Plan \nof the Ministry / Department should have \ngood understanding of roles and functions \nof the Ministry / Department, its vertical and \nhorizontal linkages for the purpose of \ndisaster management and risk reduction, \nActs and Provisions in the DM Act 2005, \nNDMP 2019 and national guidelines issued \nby NDMA. The concerned person team \nshould have understanding of all phases of \ndisaster management. For Ministries and \nDepartments of technical nature they should \nhave understanding of existing standards, \nfor disaster resilience such as BIS codes, risk \nand vulnerabilities concerning the Ministry / \nDepartment and also about various \ninternational frameworks. \n21 \nWhat is mainstreaming of \ndisaster risk reduction and \nhow can this be achieved? \nDevelopment without adequate \nincorporation of DRR could worsen existing \nrisks and has the likelihood of introducing \nnew risks, increasing the negative impact of \npotential disasters. Extensive and sound \nintegration of DRR into development can \nenhance disaster resilience, reduce losses \nand hasten the progress towards \ndevelopment goals. Thus, it is desirable that \nthe development initiatives and DRR are \n\ndealt with concurrently in a seamless \nmanner into all the relevant policies, \nplanning and implementation. The climate \nchange impacts act as risk multipliers \nworsening uncertainties associated with \nalmost every hydro-meteorological hazard. \nTherefore, all development initiatives must \nfactor in the likelihood of greater risks and \nincrease in climate change-induced \nvulnerabilities. This requires incorporation \nof risk management and climate adaptation \nas an intrinsic feature of all developmental \nefforts, especially in the areas where \nhazards are known to be high. Such an \napproach, which internalises DRR within \ndevelopment in a closely integrated manner \nis called mainstreaming DRR. It means \nradically expanding and enhancing DRR so \nthat it becomes a normal practice, fully \ninstitutionalised within each agency’s \nregular planning and programmes in \naddition to the preparedness for disaster \nresponse.)  \n \n(For more details, refer to chapter on \nMainstreaming in NDMP 2019) \n22 \nIf I have disaster \nmanagement concerns, does \nit mean that I do not take a \ndecision on L-1 basis but \ndecide a party that may give \nme more expensive \nsolution? \nIn all tender documents, DRR components \nshould be included in the design and \nstandards and should be specified in the bid \nitself.  \n \nThe bid evaluation could be a two stage \nprocess, i.e., Technical Bid Evaluation \nfollowed by Financial Bid Evaluation of \nTechnically Responsive Bids. This would \nresult in discovery of the Lowest Responsive \nEvaluated Bid (L – 1). \n\n \nIn such a case whosoever is L1 will also need \nto comply with the terms and conditions of \nthe bid to address DRR issues. \n \nTherefore, there is no question of violating \nany principle of financial propriety. \nSecondly, small sums invested today in \ndisaster risk reduction and disaster resilient \ninfrastructure will save bigger losses that \nmay occur due to disasters. Therefore, \nhaving a concern for DRR makes abundant \nfinancial sense. \n23 \nWhile preparing the DM \nPlan for my Ministry, should \nI confine to the assets of my \nMinistry / Department? \nThe Disaster Management Plan is not limited \nonly to the safety of assets of the Ministry / \nDepartment. We have to keep in mind that \nthe people of India should be the main focus \nof our disaster management concerns.

In recent \nyears, schools in India have witnessed many \ncatastrophic incidents: a fire led to the deaths of \nover 400 people —about half of them students—\nat a school’s prize giving ceremony in Dabwali \nHaryana in 1995; In 2001 a total of 31 teachers \ndied and 95 were injured; 971 students perished \nand 1,051 were injured in the Bhuj Earthquake, \nGujarat. Formal education was disrupted due to \nwidespread damage to physical infrastructure. \nMany of the buildings collapsed and many \nother were declared unfit for use. Many of these \nbuildings had been poorly constructed, lacked \nearthquake resistant features and were badly \nmaintained. A fire at the Lord Krishna School \nin Kumbakonam, Tamilnadu took the lives of \n94 children in 2004; thousands of students \nand teachers were killed, injured or otherwise \naffected in the 2004 South Asia Tsunami; and 15 \nchildren and 3 teachers died in a boat accident \nduring a school picnic at Kerala in 2007. \nEducation, public awareness and proper training \nfor enhancing the capacity is the cornerstone \nof approaches aimed at reducing vulnerabilities \nto natural hazards. The Hyogo Framework for \nAction 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of \nNations and Communities to Disasters, adopted \nat the World Conference on Disaster Reduction, \nhighlights knowledge and education as one of the \nfive main priorities of action. Attention should be \naccorded and support given to efforts targeting \nschool children and youth with the aim of making \npeople more aware of the threat of hazards and \nof the need and possibility to become better \nprepared before disasters strike.\nTowards this end, Government of India has \napproved a National School Safety Programme \n- a Demonstration Project to be implemented \nby National Disaster Management Authority  \n     To promote a culture of disaster \npreparedness in the school\n• To initiate policy level changes for ensuring\nsafe school environment.\n• To sensitize children and the school \ncommunity on disaster preparedness and \nsafety measures.\n• To motivate direct participation of key \nstakeholders in activities that would \nhelp building towards a disaster resilient \ncommunity.\n• To promote capacity building of officials, \nteachers and students.\n• To carry out Information, Education and \nCommunication (IEC) activities in schools and \nassociated environment.\n• To implement non-structural mitigation \nmeasures in select schools.\n• To carry out demonstrative structural \nretrofitting in select  schools.\nBackground\nVision\nObjective\n(NDMA) in partnership with Ministry of Human \nResource \nDevelopment \n(MHRD) \n, \nState/\nUT Governments, National and International \nAgencies in 43 districts of 22 States /UTs of the \ncountry falling in seismic zone IV & V .\n\nwithin the school premise or in the nearby area. \nThe key activities under Capacity Building \nwould be:-\n1. Development of a Standard Teachers’ \nTraining Module on School Safety at National \nlevel.\n2. Training of Master Trainers (10 Master \ntrainers per State) \n3. Training of Trainers Programme (15 trainers \nper district). \n4. Training of teachers (500 teachers, officials \netc per district) \n5. Preparation of School DM Plans in 200 \nschools in targeted Districts \n6. Review and approval of School DM Plans \nprepared by schools \n7. Distribution of School Disaster Preparedness \nKits to 200 schools in targeted district \n8. Conduct Mock drills in 200 schools in \ntargeted districts.\nC. IEC Activities\nThe school community (including teachers \nand administrative staffs) would be sensitized \non issues of disaster preparedness and \nsafety measures. The key stakeholders \nand the larger community members would \nbe motivated to participate in disaster risk \nreduction activities and to enhance disaster \nresilience. Various awareness and knowledge \nsharing programmes will be carried out \nacross the targeted districts to educate the \nschool children, teachers and government \nofficials about basic preparedness measures \nto be adopted to reduce the risk posed by \nnatural and human induced hazards. District \nInformation System for Education (DISE), \nalready existing at the district level, would be \nused in getting all school related information. \nKey activities under IEC would be:\n1. Development of IEC materials and other \nlearning aids (Booklets) for school children \nand school authorities in local language \n2. Development of IEC Material-Audio Visual. \n3. Translation, printing, dissemination of IEC \nMaterial \n4. Sensitization Programmes at State level and \nDistrict Level \n5. Preparation of District level implementation \nplan (indicating both time and resource \nrequirement) for awareness creation \n6. Selection of other stakeholders who can \npartner with Administration in creating \nawareness amongst children. Local NGOs \nand CBOs can get actively involved in this \ninitiative and can join hands with district \nadministration to carry it forward \n7. Conducting \nsensitization \nprogrammes, \nawareness programmes across the district \nfor the District Education Officers, Block \nEducation Officers, senior teachers, NDRF/\nSDRF, civil defence volunteers, NSS and \nNYKS volunteers and other stakeholders \nwho will be further involved in creating \nawareness among general public.\n8. Other district level events can also be \norganized like painting competitions for \nschool children, easy, quiz etc.\nD. Non-structural measures \nThe rapid visual survey of 200 schools in each \nof the 43 districts of 22 States/UTs will be done \nby trained technical persons. Based on the \nassessment report, non-structural mitigation \nmeasures will be taken up in these schools. The \nkey activities under Non-structural Measures \nwould be:\n1. Preparation of a standard Checklist to \nassess the existing non-structural risks in \nthe school buildings. \n2. Training of at least 2 engineers from \neach targeted Districts (43 Districts in all) \nwho are technically qualified to carry out \nassessment of the safety of the existing \nstructures. \n3. Carrying out of rapid visual screening of \n200 selected school buildings in each of \nthe targeted districts.\n4. Implementation of various non-structural \ndisaster risk mitigation measures in the \nselected schools.\n5. Sensitization programme for the students, \nteachers and associated community on the \nimportance of non-structural retrofitting. \nE. Demonstrative Retrofitting \nof one school each in 22 \nStates/UTs\n \nOne school in each of the 22 targeted States/\nUTs will be selected for structural retrofitting. \nThe structural safety of the school building \nidentified by the district administration would \nbe assessed by trained engineers from the \ndistrict public works department or hazard \nsafety cell. Based on the assessment report, \nstructural retrofitting requirements would be \nidentified and the actual retrofitting will be \ncarried out as per the guidelines being framed \non the subject by NDMA. This retrofitted school \ncould also be used as a relief shelter by the \ndistrict administration while ensuring that loss \nof instructional time in a post disaster situation \nis kept to minimum. The key activities under \nretrofitting would be:\n1. Preparation of standard check-list to assess \nthe existing structural risks in the school \nbuildings to be provided to state/district \nadministration for reference. The standard \ncheck-list can then be further  modified at \nthe local level as per the requirement. \n2. Preparation of Retrofitting Guidelines at the \nnational level.\n3. Preparation of phase-wise execution plan \nfor carrying out the retrofitting of school \nbuildings.\n4. Retrofitting of one school building in one \ndistrict each in 22 targeted States/UTs.\n5. Sensitization programme for the students, \nteachers and surrounding community on the \nimportance of structural retrofitting.\n6.

The Guidelines focus upon the urgent need to strengthen risk resilience of schools \nin rural as well as urban areas of the country. It is hoped that this document will be useful to ensure \nthat all school children across the country remain safe from any kind of disaster risk as they access \ntheir right to education.\n \nThe Guidelines highlight upon the following key elements:\n● \nAddresses the vertical of school safety in a more inclusive and holistic manner in the \nnational policy sphere\n● \nCapacity building of children, teachers, school personnel, state and district education \nmachinery on school safety and disaster preparedness\n● \nAnchoring /implementing child centered community based disaster risk reduction in \nthe local context \n● \nMainstreaming risk and safety education in the school curriculum.\n● \nLinking school safety in the existing government schemes and policies.\n● \nStrengthening coordination amongst institutional structures at the district, state, and \nnational levels to promote effective child rights governance in disaster situations\n \nChapter 1 introduces the concept and examines the importance on school safety as placed \nin the various national policies and guidelines.\n \nChapter 2 details the key challenges faced while addressing safety issues in schools, the \ncore principles of school safety which have been kept in mind while formulating the said guidelines \nand the vision and objectives of the guidelines.\n \nChapter 3 details the various activities that need to be undertaken at the state, district \nand local levels to be able to address school safety in a holistic manner. This includes, school safety \nplanning at designated levels, preparation of school disaster management plans, implementation \nof safety actions (structural and non –structural measures, capacity building of stakeholders, \nincorporation of school safety and disaster preparedness in core curriculum, monitoring of risk and \nmainstreaming of disaster risk reduction in all the school education initiatives.\n \nChapter 4 details the roles and responsibilities of the various stakeholders to ensure \nschool safety at national, state and local levels.\n \nChapter 5 highlights specific actions towards school safety that can be undertaken by \ndifferent stakeholders within the existing framework for delivery of education.\nExecutive Summary\n\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nSection 1\nIntroduction\nContent\n1.1\nDisasters as a critical threat to the well-being of \nchildren\n3\n1.2\nUnderstanding  School Safety\n3\n1.3\nNational Policy Instruments\n4\n1.4\nScope of the Guidelines\n4\n\n3\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\n1.1 \nDisasters as a critical threat to \nthe well-being of children\n'Disasters’, are defined as “a serious disruption \nof the functioning of a community or a society \ncausing widespread human, material, economic \nor environmental losses which exceed the ability \nof the affected community or society to cope \nusing its own resources”1. Due to a range of \nfactors, including age, physical ability, gender, \nhealth conditions and, dependency on care \ngivers, many children are extremely vulnerable \nin the event of a disaster. Such events cause \na serious disruption in their healthy growth \nand development as well as overall well-being. \nExperiences of fear, violence, separation from \nparents and caregivers, exploitation and abuse, \nare some of the key risks that children face. \nMoreover, the loss of livelihood of their families \ncan lead to homelessness and extreme poverty. \nAs with other infrastructure, schools are also \nexposed to disaster risk. Disasters have not \nonly challenged the government and other \nstakeholders in providing access to education but \nalso endangered the lives of children and those \nengaged in the pursuit of education.\nThere is enough evidence to reflect that the \nquality of school premises and existing capacities \nof the stakeholders have a bearing on a child’s \nvulnerability to disaster risks. Annexure 1 \nprovides details on the number of lives lost and \nthe extent of damage to school premises in some \nof the major disasters globally and nationally.\nGiven the fact that children are expected to spend \nmajority of their time at school, safe schools \nattain very high importance with a view to \nensuring their safety and well being. Schools can \nbe a safe haven for children that help them slowly \nmove back to normalcy. Within the safe school \npremises, essential supplementary nutrition for \nchildren can be provided, along with safe water \nand sanitation facilities especially for adolescent \ngirls and boys. Thus there is a global consensus \nthat schools should be resumed at the earliest in \nthe aftermath of a disaster \n1.2  \nUnderstanding School Safety\n‘School Safety’ has been defined as the creation \nof safe environments for children starting from \ntheir homes to their schools and back. This \nincludes safety from large-scale 'natural' hazards \nof geological/climatic origin, human-made risks, \npandemics, violence as well as more frequent \nand smaller-scale fires, transportation and other \nrelated emergencies, and environmental threats \nthat can adversely affect the lives of children.2 \nThe concept has evolved over the last couple of \ndecades as the threat to the physical well being \nof children has become more visible both globally \nand in the country. \nThe Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) \n2005-2015; building the Resilience of Nations \nand Communities to Disasters, adopted at \nthe World Conference on Disaster Reduction \nunderlines the importance of knowledge and \neducation as one of its five main priorities. It \ndraws attention to school children and youth \nwith the aim of making the community at large \nmore aware of the threat of hazards and become \nbetter prepared.\nThe concept of school safety in its current \nform includes safety issues both inside and \noutside the school. It includes issues of child \nprotection and safety that look at all forms of \nviolence and deprivation that affect the physical \nand mental wellbeing of children. As it stands \ntoday therefore, School Safety is a concept \nIntroduction\n1\n1. http://www.unisdr.org/eng/library/lib-terminology-\neng%20home.htm on 13 October 2013.\n2. Ahmedabad Action Agenda for School Safety, Outcome \ndocument of the International Conference on School \nSafety, 18th - 20th January, 2007, Ahmedabad, India\nSection 1\n\n4\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nthat encompasses “the creation of safe \nenvironments for children starting from \ntheir homes to their schools and back3.”\n1.3 \nNational Policy Instruments\nConstitution of India: As per the Indian \nConstitution, access to education is a fundamental \nright of each child in the country\nNational Policy on Children (2013): The \nNational \nPolicy \nfor \nChildren \nreaffirms \nthe \nGovernment‘s commitment to the realization of \nrights of all children in the country. It recognizes \nthat “every person below the age of eighteen \nyears as a child and that childhood is an integral \npart of life with a value of own, and long term, \nsustainable, \nmulti-sectoral, \nintegrated, \nand \ninclusive approach is necessary for the harmonious \ndevelopment and protection of our children”. The \nPolicy has identified survival, health, nutrition, \neducation, development, protection (including \nfrom emergencies/disasters) and participation as \nthe undeniable rights of every child, and has also \ndeclared these as key priority areas. \nNational Disaster Management Act (2005): \nThe National Disaster Management Act 2005 \nlays down the institutional, legal, financial \nand \ncoordination \nmechanisms \nfor \nDisaster \nManagement (DM) at the national, state, \ndistrict and local levels. Through the National \nInstitute of Disaster Management, the Act \nenvisages promotion of safety awareness among \nstakeholders including teachers and students.\nNational Policy on Disaster Management \n(NPDM), 2009: The National Policy on Disaster \nManagement 2009 highlights the need for \nstructural as well as non- structural safety in \nschools and educational institutions. In the \nchapter on Techno-legal Regime, in section 6.4.1, \nthe Policy identifies school buildings as a national \npriority and enables provision for designing the \nschool buildings/hostels with earthquake resilient \nfeatures and equip them with appropriate fire \nsafety measures. In the chapter on capacity \ndevelopment under section 10.2.2, the policy \nalso emphasizes upon disaster management \ntraining in all educational institutions including \nschools. Section 10.5.1 makes a reference to the \nrole of National Cadet Corps (NCC) and scouts \nand guides in schools and colleges for disaster \nmanagement related work. Section 10.6.1 of \nNPDM discusses the introduction of subject of \ndisaster management in the curriculum through \nthe Central and State Boards of Secondary \nEducation. \nNational Policy on Education (NPE) 1968, \nRevised in 1992, the National Policy on \nEducation calls for a \"child-centred approach\" \nin primary education, but does not contain a \nspecific reference to school safety or disaster risk \nissues of children.\nRight to Education Act 2009: Right to Education \n(RTE) Act 2009 guarantees free and compulsory \neducation to all the children in the country till \nthe age of 14. The Act sets minimum norms and \nstandards with regard to location and quality \nof schools and in Clause 19, lays down that no \nschool shall be established, or recognized unless \nit fulfils the norms and standards specified in the \nschedule. One of the key standards is in relation \nto access to “all weather buildings”; in “areas \nwith difficult terrain, risk of landslides, floods, \nlack of roads and in general, danger for young \nchildren in the approach…the State Government \n/ Local Authority shall locate the school in such a \nmanner as to avoid such dangers”. The Act lays \ndown the formation of the School Management \nCommittee for planning of infrastructure and \nother requirements with respect to operational \nfunctioning of schools. The School Development \nPlan, as laid out by the Act, spells out the  \nphysical requirements of additional infrastructure \nand equipments to meet the norms spelt out in \nthe schedule (in relation to all weather buildings). \nThe RTE Rules provide detailed guidance on \nimplementation of the Act on the ground.\n1.4 \nScope of the Guidelines:\nThe National School Safety Policy Guidelines \ndraw the attention of the decision makers on \nschool education in India (both government and \nprivate) upon the urgent need to strengthen risk \nresilience of schools in rural as well as urban areas \nof the country. It is hoped that this document will \nbe useful for these institutions to ensure that all \nschool children across the country remain safe \nfrom any kind of disaster risk as they access their \nright to education.\n3. Ahmedabad Action Agenda for School Safety, Outcome \ndocument of the International Conference on School \nSafety, 18th - 20th January, 2007, Ahmedabad, India\nSection 1\n\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nSection 2\nVision, Approach and Objectives of \nthe Guidelines\nContent\n2.1\nVision\n7\n2.2\nKey Challenges to Safe Schools\n7\n2.3\nApproach\n8\n2.4\nObjectives of the Policy Guidelines\n8\n\n7\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\n2.1 \nVision\nThe National School Safety Policy Guidelines \napply to all schools in the country – whether \ngovernment, aided or private, irrespective of their \nlocation in rural or urban areas. They apply to all \nstakeholders involved in delivery of education to \nchildren in India. The Guidelines stand for a vision \nof India where all children and their teachers, \nand other stakeholders in the school community \nare safe from any kind of preventable risks \ndue to natural hazards that may threaten their \nwell-being during the pursuit of education. The \nguidelines also actively promote that educational \ncontinuity is maintained / resumed even in \nthe immediate aftermath of a disaster so that \nchildren are physically, mentally and emotionally \nsecure within their schools. Right to Education \nis a fundamental right enshrined in the \nConstitution of India. In order to facilitate \naccess of all children in the country with respect \nto the Right to Education, it is important to \nensure that children remain safe as they access \nand enjoy their Right to Education. \n2.2 \nKey Challenges for Safe Schools\nEfforts on school safety at the National and State \nlevels are at an evolving stage. Key challenges in \nimplementation of school safety measures include: \n●\t\nDisconnect \nbetween \ninstitutions: \nThere is a visible disconnect between the \n‘non-emergency’ schemes (Pertaining to \nEducation) such as Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan \nand Disaster response / preparedness. \nEducation programmes are executed in \nmost states with little synergy or policy \nlinkages with the SDMA / DDMA.\n●\t\nLimited \nconvergence \nbetween \nschemes: Resources required for effective \nimplementation of a govt. scheme cannot \nbe leveraged in the absence of a mechanism \nfor collaborative working with other budget \nholders. For instance, land development \nwithin the school campus may be funded \nthrough Mahatma Gandhi National Rural \nEmployment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). \nHowever, close coordination between micro \nplanning activity for MGNREGA and School \nDevelopment Plan preparation would be \nnecessary for convergence.\n●\t\nLimited \nunderstanding \nof \nschool \nsafety concept: It is evident that the \nexisting \neducation \nmachinery \nin \nthe \ncountry is keen to promote safe learning \nenvironment for children and teachers but \nactual implementation of programmes on \nground points to limited understanding of \nthe concept of safety. At best, new school \ndesigns incorporate earthquake safety \nfeatures in many areas; however floods, \ncyclones, landslides have been given little \nattention in design and costing of schools. \nIn addition non-structural elements are \noften not understood as threats to safety. \nAt the level of teachers and students, safety \nissues are discussed and pursued as one off \nactivities. School timetable and curriculum \nneed suitable modifications to make safety \nunderstanding a routine activity.\nThe National School Safety Policy Guidelines \nemphasize on the need for active mainstreaming \nof disaster risk reduction in all the school education \ninitiatives in the country. This would require \na collaborative approach between the state \neducation departments and the state disaster \nmanagement machinery. Collaboration, would be \nnecessary especially for capacity development \nactivities such as sensitization of officials, public \nawareness on disasters, training of students \nand teachers; pre-positioning equipments for \nemergency response, creation of educational \nmaterial on disasters and, monitoring of risk.\nVision, Approach and  \nObjectives of the Guidelines\n2\nSection 2\n\n8\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\n2.3 \nApproach to Implementation\nFundamental principles that form the core \napproach of these guidelines are given below:\n2.3.1  All hazard approach\nSchool Safety efforts need to take cognizance \nof all kinds of hazards that may affect the well-\nbeing of children. These may include natural \nhazards such as floods and earthquakes as well \nas manmade hazards. Hazards include structural \nand non- structural factors. Structural factors \ninclude dilapidated buildings, poorly designed \nstructures, faulty construction, poorly maintained \ninfrastructure, loose building elements, etc. while \nnon structural factors include loosely placed \nheavy objects such as almirahs, infestation of the \ncampus by snakes and any other pests, broken \nor no boundary walls, uneven flooring, blocked \nevacuation routes, poorly designed and placed \nfurniture that may cause accidents and injury, \ninadequate sanitation facilities etc. Safety of \nchildren, their teachers and parents needs to be \napproached holistically to include visible as well \nas invisible risks that may be sudden on-set or \nhave built-up slowly over a period of time.\n2.3.2  Strengthening \nexisting \npolicy \nprovisions to make schools safer\nThere has been substantial investment by the \nGovernment in creating infrastructure for the \neducation sector. There is need to ensure that all \nthe existing and new infrastructure is resilient to \nlocally relevant hazards through the design and \nconstruction processes. Unsafe structures can \nincrease the vulnerability of children who are the \nprimary target group of such efforts. Thus it is \nimportant to ensure that all development actions \ntaken even in non-emergency times are designed \nwith a view to ensuring their performance during \nemergencies.\nIt is imperative that the existing institutions at \nthe national and state level are strengthened \nand capacitated to take responsibility of school \nsafety planning and action. Such a step will \nnot only ensure that development policies and \nprogrammes are strengthened but also provide \nthe necessary succor to safety actions.\n2.3.3  School Safety as an indicator of \nquality for planning, execution and \nmonitoring \nSchool Safety is not a onetime effort but a \ncontinuous process. Safety principles need to be \nincorporated in the day to day functioning of the \neducational institutions in the country, cutting \nacross the traditional stages of the disaster \ncycle: preparedness, response and recovery. \nThus institutions involved in providing education \nin the country need to evolve a methodology and \nan approach of their own that looks at safety as a \ncontinuously monitored indicator of quality.\n2.4  \nObjectives \nof \nthe \nPolicy \nGuidelines\nThe primary objective of the National School \nSafety Policy Guidelines is to ensure the  \ncreation of safe learning environment for children. \nThe Policy Guidelines also seek to highlight \nspecific actions towards school safety that can be \nundertaken by different stakeholders within the \nexisting framework for delivery of education.\nSection 2\n\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nSection 3\nAction areas\nContent\n3.1\nStrengthening \ninstitutional \ncommitment \nto \nsafe \nlearning environment for children\n11\n3.2\nPlanning for safety\n12\n3.3\nImplementation of safety actions\n14\n3.4\nCapacity building for safe schools\n16\n3.5\nRegular monitoring of risk and revision of plan\n18\n\n11\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\n3.1 \nStrengthening \nInstitutional \nCommitment to Safe Learning \nEnvironment for Children \nThe first and foremost step in promoting safety \nof learning spaces is to sensitize and strengthen \nofficial structures and mechanisms responsible \nfor safety at the State, District and Local levels. \n3.1.1 \nInstitutional Strengthening at the \nState and District Level\nThe institutional and regulatory framework as \nlaid down in the various National Acts provides \nfor realizing the Right to Education as well \nas Disaster Management in the country. For \nensuring that students and their teachers remain \nsafe in pursuit of education, it is necessary \nthat the two institutional frameworks act in \nconvergence with each other, through the \nphases of preparedness, response and recovery. \nThe Right to Education Act (RTE) guarantees free \nand compulsory education to all the children in \nthe country till the age of 14 based on minimum \nnorms and standards that are mandatory for \nany school in the country to be “established, \nor recognized”. It recognizes the need for “all \nweather buildings” and limitations posed by \ndifficulty of terrain, risk of landslides, floods, \nlack of roads and in general, danger for young \nchildren in approach etc.\nThe RTE Act thus serves as a strong base for \npromoting school safety. The framework for \nimplementation of RTE-SSA has a strong focus \non Disaster Management\nThe National Disaster Management Act, 2005 \nmandates \nthe \nState \nDisaster \nManagement \nAuthorities (SDMA) to provide guidelines for \ndifferent departments to integrate disaster \nprevention and mitigation measures in their \ndevelopment \nplans \nand \nprovide \nnecessary \ntechnical assistance thereof. The SDMA needs to \nwork closely with the State Education Department \nto support the school safety efforts at the state \nlevel.\nThere is a need to co-opt senior officials of the \nDepartment of Education at the State and the \nDistrict level as part of the State and District \nDisaster Management Authorities for promotion \nof safe schools. In addition, a School Safety \nAdvisory Committee may be formed to advise \nthe education department on the subject.\nThis will ensure that school safety can be \npractically promoted through convergent action \nby the SDMA / DDMA and the education machinery \nat the state and district level. \nAs a direct consequence of this institutional \ndovetailing / convergence, the state and district \ndisaster management plans will include a focus \non educational infrastructure and supportive \naction thereof, such as status of education \ninfrastructure from a risk resilience perspective, \ncapacity building of different stakeholders on \nsafety aspects, and large scale awareness on \ndisasters among students and the community at \nlarge. In parallel, the education machinery also \nneeds to strengthen their efforts with respect to \npromoting school safety for government, aided \nas well as private schools.\nThe District Education Officer must ensure that \n‘Recognition Certificate’ under sub-rule (4) 15 \nof Right of Children to Free and Compulsory \nEducation Rules, 2010 is issued only to those \nschools that comply with safety norms laid out \nin the Building Codes. This compliance needs to \nbe monitored on a regular basis.\nIn addition, a mechanism needs to be evolved \nby the District Education Officer and designated \nRegulatory Authorities for monitoring safety \nparameters in all schools on a regular basis. Any \nexisting monitoring formats being used by the \nAuthorities shall essentially include parameters \non school safety as well.\nAction Areas\n3\nSection 3\n\n12\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nIn addition, each district should designate the \nBlock Education Officer or any other official as \nappropriate, for over-seeing and facilitating \nschool safety at the block level.\n3.1.2 \nInstitutional Strengthening at the \nLocal Level for Preparedness and \nResponse \nAt the local level, both in rural as well as urban \nareas, the school community broadly includes \nchildren, \nschool \nteachers, \nthe \nPrincipal \n/ \nHeadmaster and parents. These are the primary \nstakeholders of the school affairs and may be \nrepresented formally or informally in decision \nmaking bodies for the school. It is imperative \nthat these existing institutions at the school level \nare strengthened, and their potential adequately \ntapped for ensuring wellbeing of children and \nteachers from a disaster safety perspective. \nUnder the SSA, the School Management \nCommittee has been designated as the body \nresponsible for managing the affairs of the school in a \ntransparent and “bottom – up” participatory manner.\nThe School Management Committee needs to \nbe made responsible for taking on the safety \nagenda at the community and school level. The \nSchool Management Committee needs to be \nsensitized and oriented on their expected role.\nAt the school level, a School Safety Focal \nPoint Teacher (FPT) needs to be nominated \nto operationally anchor safety related actions \nat the school level as part of his / her routine \ncommitments in the School. The School Safety \nFocal Point Teachers also need to be provided \nthe necessary training to anchor the process and \nfoster action by different stakeholders responsible \nfor various activities. \nThe School Management Committee in each \nschool should be adequately trained for different \naspects of school safety in case of an imminent \ndisaster/emergency, e.g. sanitation and hygiene \nneeds of boys, girls and teachers; first aid; \nstampede \nmanagement; \nfire \nmanagement \nand control, handling of chemicals /hazardous \nmaterials in labs etc.\nEach school should also identify and develop a \ncadre of peer educators / trainers for ensuring \nthat safety messages, dos and don’ts of different \ndisasters, procedures and protocols, reach each \nand every student in the school. These peer \neducators can be trained through National Cadet \nCorps, National scouts and guides camps, by \nthe Red Cross or any other agency as deemed \nfit by the district.\nMany private schools have in place mechanisms \nto address everyday issues in relation to school \nexpansion and development, fire drills, power \noutage procedures, early dismissals on account \nof unexpected weather events, health and safety \nconcerns, trespassers or road/bus accidents. \nHowever the nature and effectiveness of these \nmechanisms varies. These mechanisms need to \nbe made more inclusive as far as children are \nconcerned as well as be more pro-active with \nregard to issues on safety.\n3.2 \nPlanning for Safety\nSchool safety planning needs to be undertaken \nat the district level as well as at the local /school \nlevel. \n3.2.1 \nPlanning at the district level – links \nwith district level DM efforts\nThe District Disaster Management Plans (DDMPs) \nneed to incorporate concerns and solutions for \naddressing safety related gaps in all the schools \nin the district and their surrounding environs. \nMoreover schools often serve as emergency \nshelter locations in the immediate aftermath of a \ndisaster. Hence the DDMAs need to make sure that \nschool safety is given due attention in the DDMPs. \nDDMP should, at the minimum include: \n●\t\nDistrict level baseline of schools \nto be made safer. These can be \nassessed \nthrough \n‘Rapid \nVisual \nScreening’ or any other tool to cover \nall hazards relevant to the area.\n●\t\nProximity of emergency and crisis \nservice agencies , their capabilities \nand consequently their expected \nresponse time; \n●\t\nPhysical \ncapacity \nof \nschool \ninfrastructure and facilities to resist \nknown hazards that are relevant to \nthe local context; \n●\t\nInformation \nrelated \nto \nexisting \nresources \nand \ncapacities \nwithin \nthe school and the community with \nregard to disaster management; \nSection 3\n\n13\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\n●\t\nInformation related to hazards and \nrisks posed by other facilities in \nthe vicinity of the school e.g. any \nindustrial establishments producing \nhazardous materials. \n3.2.2 \nPlanning at the school level – \ninclusive and ongoing action\nPlanning for emergencies at the school level cannot \nbe done in isolation from the school community \nand the official structures responsible for schools. \nTherefore the planning exercise must be inclusive \n– involving wide range of representatives from \nthe school and its neighbouring communities, \nincluding school administrators, school principals, \nschool staff, students and key representatives \nfrom the community.\nIt is equally important to recognize that planning \nfor safety at the school level is not a one time or \nstatic process; it is an ‘on-going’ dynamic process \ninvolving identification of safety needs, developing \nprevention, response and preparedness protocols, \nevaluating physical facilities, and providing \ncommunication and training for staff members \nand students.\nThe existing planning processes and protocols at \nthe school level need to be adapted to adequately \ninclude safety concerns. For private and unaided \nschools, the National Accreditation Board for \nEducation and Training needs to monitor safety \naspects. In addition, as per the DM Act, DDMA \nneeds to monitor all school buildings for their \ncompliance with building codes.\nFor schools under SSA, the current process \nof preparation of annual School Development \nPlans needs to reinforce focus on safety \naspects. \nA \ncomprehensive \nassessment \nof \nneeds, conducted prior to the development of \nthe School Development Plan (SDP) is essential \nfor identifying the possible risks for children as \nwell as their capabilities to respond and recover \nfrom critical incidents. The assessment should \nconsider the history of natural disaster risk in \nthe area and natural vulnerabilities, physical \nfactors, such as the location of the school with \nregard to existing / emerging hazards, for \nexample flooding due to proximity of a water \nbody, building code requirements in relation \nto school structures as well as non-structural \ncomponents that may threaten the well-being \nof children. It should also consider emergency \nuses of the school facility such as, school being \ndesignated as a relief shelter in the District \nDisaster Management Plans.\nThe School Management Committee members, \nchildren and teachers being the primary users \nof the school are in the best position to identify \nand plan for addressing hazards and risks that \nmay threaten their safety. Once the School \nManagement Committee has been formed and \noriented to school safety issues, a dedicated group \nof individuals is available to lead the process of \nidentifying risks and vulnerabilities. \nAny appropriate tool may be used to conduct the \nprocess of identifying needs in a participatory \nmanner. For instance, ‘Hazard hunt’ exercise is a \ntested method to identify risks, both inside and \noutside the school precincts that may threaten \nthe safety of the school community. It involves \nidentifying all kinds of hazards including those that \ncan cause physical harm such as deep potholes, \nlack of boundary walls; those that affect the \nhealth of children such as contaminated water \nsources, absence of toilets and hand washing \nfacilities; as well those factors that are outside \nthe school per se such as fast moving traffic on \nthe road outside, ponds etc. (Refer Annexure 7)\nBased on the assessment of needs, the School \nDevelopment Plan needs to be prepared by the \nSchool Management Committee. NDMA through \nSDMA and DDMA will provide standard tool kits \nand render other inputs to facilitate the process. \n(Format of School DM Plan is available as \nAnnexure 8)\nThe plan would comprise measures to be taken \nboth within school premises and in the immediate \nneighborhood including:\n1. \nShort term interventions : both non-\nstructural and structural activities\n2. \nLong- term interventions : both non-\nstructural and structural activities\n3. \nTraining plan: For students and teachers \n4. \nKnowledge \nbuilding \nplan \nincluding \nawareness creation, mass sensitization, \nmock-drills including follow up through \nregular school timetable. This would also \ninclude the use and regular maintenance \nof emergency equipments such as fire \nextinguishers.\n5. \nReview and Monitoring plan including \nsafety audit, availability of emergency \nequipment and materials\nSection 3\n\n14\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nSSA also mentions, “..School Development Plan \nshould emerge from a process of micro planning \nundertaken \nin \na \nparticipatory \nmanner..The \npreparation of the School Development Plan may \nbe undertaken by a core team, led by a School \nManagement Committee member from the village/\nhabitation, and comprising selected community \nleaders, NGO representatives, Head Teacher, \nselected teachers and parents, especially parents \nof children from disadvantaged groups and \nweaker sections, and children with special needs... \nand would include, inter alia.. preparation of a \nproposal for improved education facilities..” (SSA \nFramework for Implementation, 2009, pp 137)\nIn parallel, the plan also needs to be consulted/ \nbrought in picture with the village Panchayat \nfor exploring opportunities for leveraging other \nschemes.\n3.2.3 \nSchool Disaster Management Plan\nSchools \nshould \nalso \ndevelop \na \nDisaster \nManagement \nPlan \ndefining \nprocedures \nto \nconfine, contain, consolidate and control the \nemergency and crisis, with inputs from DDMA.\nThis plan should include among other aspects, \nsystem of warnings, communication protocols \nwithin and outside the school (including usage \nof public addressal system), identification of \nevacuation routes, access by emergency vehicles \nand care of children with special needs. The \nDisaster Management Plan should also include \nstock piling of emergency equipment and \nmaterials, regular maintenance of emergency \nequipment, arrangements for orderly release \nof students to guardians and temporary shelter, \nin case required. A site map should be included \nin the plan, designating planned evacuation \nroutes and assembly areas. The same should be \ndisplayed on each floor of the school. A copy of \nthe plot map and floor plan for each school with \nthese details should be submitted to the DDMA \nfor inclusion in the DDMP.\n3.3 \nImplementation \nof \nsafety \nactions\n3.3.1 \nAppropriate Siting, Design and \ndetailing for structural safety in new \nschools and repairing of existing \nschools\nAll existing as well as new schools need to \nconform to safety standards as per the National \nBuilding Code. In addition, any other norms \nprescribed by the state government need to be \nadhered to. (Refer Annexure 6)\nSome of these actions are given below:\n● \nNew schools should be located, on a site \nthat has adequate mitigation measures \nalready in place against any imminent \nnatural hazards. Existing schools located \nin a vulnerable location should either be \nrelocated at a safer site or they should \nbe provided adequate support to mitigate \nthe effect of any natural hazards that may \naffect the area.\n● \nAll \nnew \nschool \nconstructions \nshould \ninclude disaster resilient features. Existing \nvulnerable schools need to be repaired to \nthe desired level of resilience with regard \nto local disaster risks.\n● \nPrescribed designs may be adapted to \naccommodate safety and child friendly \nfeatures.\n● \nFor design of structural standards of school \nbuilding and its components such as \ncorridors, staircases, side areas, quality of \nconstruction should be as per the National \nBuilding Code 2005. Only non-combustible, \nfire-proof, heat resistant materials shall be \nused in school construction.\n● \nVertical expansion of existing schools \nshall not be carried out without a fitness \ncertificate for the building from a certified \ncivil / structural engineer.\n● \nAdditional \nclassrooms \nor \nany \nother \nstructures requiring horizontal expansion \nshall be designed taking into account the \nspace availability and while constructing as \na continuous unit to the existing structures, \nthese should be designed to have less \nimpact of seismic forces.\n● \nEach class room should have two doors \nfor easy evacuation; adequate openings \nfor ventilation and lighting are some of \nthe essential elements that need to be \naccommodated in the design.\n● \nDoors opening outside, into open areas or \ncorridors of adequate width are key details \nthat need to be incorporated to make \nschools safer. \nSection 3\n\n15\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nAll of these and any other additional ones, \nrequire the guidance and support of a panel of \ntechnical agencies to be identified at the state \nlevel and designated to work in specific districts. \nIn this manner location specific designs can be \nworked out with adequate attention to safety \nfeatures as well as child friendly elements. \nBesides these details, other design solutions \nin line with the Whole School Development \nConcept need to be incorporated to promote \nsafety and child friendly features. Elements \npertaining \nto \nschool \nsafety \nshould \nbe  \nincluded in the whole school development \napproach.\n3.3.2 \nNonstructural safety measures in \nschools\nBesides structural safety measures, non structural \nelements within the school campus need to be \naddressed to ensure safety. These are mostly low \ncost, regular maintenance items that the school \nshould address on a regular basis from their own \nfunds. Some of these items have been listed \nbelow:\n● \nAll items of furniture such as almirahs, \nshelves, black boards etc., as well as any \nother items that may fall and cause injury \nto students and teachers such as ceiling \nfans, coolers, water tanks etc. need to be \nsecured to the walls or floor.\n● \nAny electrical items such as loose wires \nthat may cause an exigency should be \naddressed promptly by the school.\n● \nChemical and any hazardous materials \nin \nthe \nschool \nlaboratory \nshould \nbe  \nhandled and stored as per instructions to \nprevent any harm to students and school \nstaff.\n● \nOpen \nareas \nincluding \ncorridors \nand \nevacuation routes including staircases and \nramps should be kept free from any hurdles \nand barriers so that evacuation is smooth \nand swift.\n● \nPots / planters in the play ground or \ncorridors should be kept in a manner that \ndoes not affect smooth evacuation\n● \nAny derelict or unused building, rubble, etc. \nshould be removed to prevent any harmful \nanimals or pests from accessing children. \n● \nTraffic movement outside the school should \nbe managed to minimize risk to students \nat the time of assembling and dispersal of \nschool. \n● \nDuring excursions, schools should carefully \nchoose the location of excursion and the \nitinerary so that exposure to hazard is \nminimized. Extra precautions should be taken \nwhen students are being taken close to water \nbodies, narrow mountainous tracks etc.\n● \nBuses or any other vehicles owned / hired by \nthe school need to be maintained properly \nso that students are not at risk of accidents. \nDrivers need to be appropriately trained on \nspeed limits, stoppage of vehicles as well as \ncrisis management so that children remain \nsafe during their travel to and from schools. \n● \nEmergency \nequipment \nsuch \nas \nfire \nextinguishers, first aid kits, ropes etc. need \nto be procured and maintained regularly by \nthe School Authorities. \nVarious Dimensions of School Safety – building on the Whole School Development Approach\nSection 3\n\n16\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\n● \nThe figure on page 15 articulates various \ndimensions of school safety as part of the \nWhole School Development Plan(WSDP) \nfrom \nthe \nperspective \nof \nthe \nSchool \nCommunity:\nFire Prevention and Fire Safety \nFire Prevention and Fire Safety measures should \nbe part of initial school design, and also require \nregular maintenance and testing. The following \nmust be ensured:\n• \nFlammable \nand \nhazardous \nmaterials \nsources are limited, isolated, eliminated, \nor secured. This includes electrical lines \nand appliances, heaters and stoves, \nnatural gas pipelines and LPG canisters, \nflammable or combustible liquids;\n• \nExit routes are clear to facilitate safe \nevacuation in case of fire or other \nemergency;\n• \nDetection and alarm systems (especially \nurban set ups) are working;\n• \nFire extinguishers are regularly refilled;\n• \nOther fire materials and equipment are \nregularly maintained;\n• \nElectrical systems are maintained and \noperable, in compliance with fire safety \ndesign criteria (Source: Adapted from IFC \nEHS Guidelines)\n3.3.3 \nLeveraging \nexisting \nflagship \nprogrammes \nto \nmake \nschool \ncampus safer \nAreas that have a history of disaster risk recognize \nthe value of schools both during an emergency \nas well as for helping children achieve a sense of \nnormalcy in the aftermath of a disaster. Therefore \nschools are a valuable asset for any community \nfor the various purposes they serve not only for \nchildren but for their families and communities. \nTherefore, local authorities need to have a strong \nsense of urgency for ensuring school safety. \nIn addition, schools can be instrumental in \ncreating an overall ‘culture of safety’ within the \nneighboring community through children and \nteachers. Hence, the relevance of school safety \nefforts goes much beyond the school itself.\nSchool safety cannot be ensured by the efforts of \nthe school authorities alone. The broader context \nof the school has a vital role to play in ensuring \nsafety since school precincts and the facilities \ntherein are provided through different schemes \nand programmes. Often these schemes and \nprogrammes are rather disconnected with the \nschool affairs and special needs of children. \nSSA also recognizes, “..following the micro-\nplanning exercise, the blocks and districts should \nundertake an exercise to see which requirements \ncan be fulfilled either by redeployment /\nrationalisation of existing resources or through \nother schemes of the Central/State Governments. \nThe SDP may be appraised by the Cluster level \nunits, in consultation with the Block teams. The \nDistrict unit will appraise the Block level plans \nwhich will form the basis of the district plan…” \n(SSA Framework for Implementation, 2009, \npp 138)\nThe School Development Plan detailing possible \nsources of funding for different components \nof school safety including SSA, Backward \nAreas Grant Fund, National Rural Employment \nGuarantee Scheme, Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan, \nTribal Areas Sub-Plan, MPLAD etc. needs to be \nshared with Panchayati Raj Institutions / Urban \nLocal bodies and other local level institutions \nfor their participation and support. Components \nof the School Development Plan that can be \nincluded in the Panchayat Plans for Backward \nAreas Grant Fund, National Rural Employment \nGuarantee Scheme, etc. need to be subsequently \nfollowed up with the relevant departments along \nwith the PRIs/ Urban Local Bodies so that they \nare executed in a timely fashion with the desired \nquality– with a focus on children and a focus on \nsafety.\nThose activities that the school can undertake \non its own such as non-structural mitigation \nmeasures for instance, clearing evacuation \nroutes and addressing loose hanging objects, \nneeds to be taken up by the Department of \nSchool Education.\n3.4  \nCapacity Building for Safe \nSchools\nA critical enabler for promotion of safety at the \nschool level is deeper understanding, sensitivity \nand overall capacity of the concerned stakeholders \nin relation to the issue of school safety. \nSection 3\n\n17\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nCapacity building for school safety covers a range \nof actions spanning from awareness generation \nand sensitization to training on direct actions \nrequired by different stakeholders. Additionally, \ncapacity building is not a one-time activity; it \nrequires follow up of knowledge and skills imparted \nand regular value additions in the day to day \nworking of teachers, students and school staff. \nCapacity building actions for safe schools fall \nbroadly in two categories:\n3.4.1 \nGeneral training for students and \nschool staff:\nDelineating their expected roles, procedures and \nresponsibilities in relation to any emergency, \nthis \ntraining \nwould \ninclude \nstrengthening \nunderstanding of:\na. \nPotential disasters that may affect the \nschool community;\nb. \nWarning signals, emergency and crisis \ninstructions and mitigation actions for \ndifferent levels of response.\nc. \nEvacuation routes, and knowledge of safe \nspaces and shelter locations;\nd. \nFirst-aid and basic life support\ne. \nAvailability of personal and group counseling \nand support following a disaster; and \nf. \nUpdates in the disaster management plan \nthat affect the total population of the \nschool.\nThese trainings are necessary for preparation \nand regular up-dation of school level disaster \nmanagement plans as well as for effective \nexecution in case the need arises. Therefore \nregular practice through mock-drill exercises \ninvolving teachers together with children is critical \nfor sustaining the impact of safety initiatives. \nAwareness programmes for children on local \nhazards and risk reduction with relevant \nknowledge and life skills through discussions, \nstreet \nplays, \ndrawing \ncompetitions, \nquiz \ncompetitions, \nessay/ \nslogan \nwriting \nand \ndemonstration are proven ways of involving \nchildren in a meaningful manner. In addition, \nrallies, games/matches and other community \nlevel activities may be organised with inputs \nfrom DDMA/SDMA to make children as well as \nthe larger community aware.\n3.4.2 \nSpecialized \ntraining \nand \nskill \nbuilding:\nTraining would be imparted for performing \nspecialized roles as part of the School Disaster \nManagement Plan, for instance: \na. \nSpecific duties and procedures assigned to \nstudents, faculty and staff as part of the \nSchool Disaster Management Plan e.g. first \naid training, search and rescue etc.\nb. \nCoordination of the school safety needs \nassessment and integration of these needs \nwith the School Development Plan by School \nSafety Focal Point Teacher and Principals.\nc. \nPsycho-social support for students who \ncan benefit from counseling, undertaking \nactivities on trauma management, through \nwriting or art projects as well as making \nappropriate changes in the curriculum, for \nhealing and learning coping skills.\nSuch specialized skills can best be imparted \nby specialized institutions. State Governments \nneed to establish a formal mechanism such as \na Joint Plan of Action with specialized agencies \nsuch as SDRF and the Red Cross. SDMA needs \nto involve SDRF in training of Education Officer, \nSMC, Focal Point Teachers and student peer \neducators on practical skills such as search \nand rescue, first aid, basic - life support etc. \nBesides the School Safety Focal Point Teachers, \nall other teachers should be sensitized through \nthe SDMA/DDMA .In addition, District Institutes \nof Education and Training(DIETs) should also \ninclude school safety as part of their pre-service \nand in-service training programmes.\nSchool Safety Focal point teachers need to be \nprovided training on school safety concept and \nvarious activities related to execution of their \nresponsibilities as the School Safety Focal point \nteachers. State Council for Education and Training \n(SCERT) should train Master Trainers from each \nDistrict Institute of Education and Training (DIET) \nand Master Trainers of each DIET should in turn \nimpart training to school level stakeholders.\nThe content for training on school safety at \nall levels should be generated by SCERT, in \nconsultation with SDMA/DDMA. In addition, \nSCERT needs to develop child friendly teaching \nmaterial for teachers and students to engage \nthem on school safety issues. \nSection 3\n\n18\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nThe School Management Committee needs \nto be trained on assessment of safety needs, \ndeveloping plans as well as safety audit which \nneeds to be conducted quarterly. This includes \nchecks to ensure that facilities and resources \nwithin the school are maintained viz. safe water \nand sanitation, first aid kits, fire extinguishers etc. \nDisaster Management in Core Curriculum \nDedicated actions for building the capacity of \nstudents and staff in schools are needed to create \na “culture of safety” within the larger community \nto which the students and teachers belong. This \n“culture of safety” would be an outcome of the \ncollective efforts of the educational institutional \nmachinery with other institutions concerned \nwith disaster risk such as the State and District \nDisaster Management Authorities. \nOn their part, Central Board of Secondary \nEducation, State Boards of Secondary Education \n(SCERT), and other institutions involved in \ncurriculum development need to include age \nappropriate theoretical as well as practical \nknowledge on risk of disasters, nationally and \nspecifically about their own state.\nPractical training on health promotion and disease \nprevention \nconcepts \nand \nhealth-enhancing \nbehaviors and life skills is important.\nList of Trainings required for promotion of \nschool safety is available in Annexure 3\nPeer Education and Use of Child Friendly \nMethods\nThe strategy of peer–to-peer education is a \ntested strategy for imparting specific knowledge \non disasters such that it reaches each and every \nstudent within the school.\nThis strategy not only promises extended \noutreach, it also facilitates the development \nof leadership skills in the students at school \nand within their community. Peer education \nfor disaster management may be extended to \npeer mediation in cases of bullying or any other \nincidences of violence that can be resolved by \nstudents themselves.\nIt is also important to ensure that appropriate \nchild friendly techniques are used in the process \nof skill building. Use of songs, skits, puppet \nshows, drawing competitions, quiz competitions, \nessay/ slogan writing and demonstration are \nproven ways of transferring knowledge and \nskills to children.\n3.5 \nRegular monitoring of risk and \nrevision of plan\nImplementation of National School Safety Policy \nGuidelines needs to be monitored at the national \nlevel jointly by MHRD and NDMA. At the state \nlevel, implementation of the Guidelines needs \nto be monitored by State Education Department \nand SDMA.\nSSA Framework offers broad guidelines on \nprovisioning of School Infrastructure facilities. \nTherefore, suitable indicators to monitor disaster \nrisk to children may be developed/monitored by \nthe State Governments based on their specific \nconditions in assistance with SDMAs.\nThe education machinery at State/district level \nneeds to strengthen their efforts at promoting \nschool safety for aided as well as private schools. \nThe District Education Officer must ensure that \n‘Recognition Certificate’ under sub-rule (4) 15 \nof Right of Children to Free and Compulsory \nEducation Rules, 2010 is issued only to those \nschools that comply with safety norms laid out \nin the Building Codes. This compliance needs to \nbe monitored on a regular basis. In addition, a \nmechanism needs to be evolved by the District \nEducation Officer and any other Regulatory \nAuthorities for monitoring safety parameters \nin all schools on a regular basis. Any existing \nmonitoring formats being used by the Authorities \nshall essentially include parameters on school \nsafety.\nIn addition, each district should designate the \nBlock Education Officer or any other official as \nappropriate, for overseeing and facilitating school \nsafety at the block level.\nTo ensure that schools remain ‘safe’ for the \nstudents and the teachers, it is important that \nthe School Development Plans are reviewed \nand updated regularly by School Management \nCommittee on a quarterly basis. There could be \ncases of unaddressed hazards and additional \nnew hazards that emerge in the course of the \nimplementation of the School Development \nPlan. These will be integrated into the School \nDevelopment Plan through the process of \nreview and up-dation. In addition, there may be \nrisks that have to be monitored periodically to \nsafeguard the health and well-being of children, \nsuch as cleanliness of toilets and quality of \ndrinking water.\nSection 3\n\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nSection 4\nRoles and Responsibilities of \nDifferent Stakeholders\nContent\n4.1\nState Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs)\n21\n4.2\nDistrict Disaster Management Authorities (DDMAs)\n21\n4.3\nNational level Education Authorities\n21\n4.4\nState level Education Authorities\n22\n4.5\nDistrict and Block level Education Authorities\n22\n4.6\nSCERT and DIETs\n22\n4.7\nSchool administration\n23\n4.8\nAccreditation and Registration Authorities for \nschools\n23\n4.9\nPRIs / Urban Local Bodies and Line Departments\n23\n4.10\nSchool Children\n23\n\n20\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\n4.11\nNon - Governmental Organizations (local, regional \nand international)\n24\n4.12\nCorporate bodies\n24\n4.13\nInternational Funding Agencies and United Nations\n24\n4.14\nMedia\n24\nSection 4\n\n21\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nRight of school children to a safe learning \nenvironment cannot be upheld by only one \ninstitution. The National Policy on Disaster \nManagement reinforces that disaster management \nis everyone’s business; a single individual or \nagency cannot, on their own be responsible for \nsafeguarding the interest of the future generation. \nThere is a need for a more practical linkage \nbetween the national, state and local governance \nstructures so that the overall well- being of \nchildren and teachers as well as their families can \nbe promoted. Moreover, these structures need to \nwork together along with the school community to \nnot only address primary risks (floods, earthquake, \netc.) but also underlying risks and vulnerabilities \nto singularly define ‘safety’ as a quality issue in \neducation facilities whether government, aided or \nprivately owned.\nThe \nroles \nand \nresponsibilities \nof \ndifferent \nstakeholders are given below:\n4.1 \nState Disaster Management \nAuthorities (SDMAs):\n● \nCollaborate with and involve education \nauthorities \nin \nDM \nplanning, \npolicies, \nprocesses and in developing minimum \nstandards for school safety before, during \nand after emergencies.

In 2008 Haiti earthquake, half of the schools in the country was destroyed \n(Reliefweb 2008). The Sichuan Earthquake in 2008 caused collapse of over 7,000 school buildings \n(Reliefweb, 2008).  The 2005 Kashmir earthquake resulted in collapse of over 8000 schools on both \nsides of the border; altogether over 18000 children lost their lives while at school (BBC 2005).\nA fire led to the death of about 200 children at the prize giving ceremony at a school in Dabwali, \nHaryana in 1995; a total of 31 teachers died and 95 were injured.  During the 2001 Gujarat Earthquake \nover 11,600 schools were destroyed/ damaged; 971 students perished and 1,051 were injured. \n(World Bank 2001). Similarly the fire at Lord Krishna School in Kumbakonam, Tamilnadu caused \ndeath of 94 children and thousands of students and teachers were impacted in South India in the \naftermath of the 2004 Tsunami.\nCause for such state of affairs has largely been poor quality of construction, lack of disaster \nresilient features and poor maintenance of schools. The fact remains that schools are indeed \nspaces where children and teachers spend a large part of their day. Therefore the quality of these \nspaces has a bearing on their vulnerability to disaster risk.\nAnnexures\nAnnexure\n\n36\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nAnnexure – 2\nEfforts on School Safety in India\nThe agenda of School Safety, as is visible in India today is preceded by the efforts of different \ngovernments in the country to promote the constitutional mandate of providing access to free \nand compulsory education for all children up to the age of 14 years. This was followed up in the \nNational Policy of Education (NPE) and the Programme of Action (POA) 1992 that led to a number \nof schemes and programmes including Operation Blackboard (OB); Non Formal Education (NFE); \nTeacher Education (TE); Mahila Samakhya (MS); State specific Basic Education Projects like the \nAndhra Pradesh Primary Education Project (APPEP), District Primary Education Programme (DPEP) \nand currently the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA). The mandate of SSA goes beyond provision of \neducation alone per se; rather it aims to provide ‘useful’ and ‘quality’ elementary education to \nall children in the 6 -14 age group. About 33% funds of SSA are spent on civil works including \nconstruction of schools, additional classrooms and Block Resource Centres / Urban Resource \nCentres / Cluster Resource Centres. These are designed in line with the Whole School Development \nPlan that includes a focus on safety. For children over the age of 14, the Rashtriya Madhyamik \nShiksha Abhiyan has been launched.\nDisaster Management was introduced as a subject in the Central Board school curriculum, as well \nas several State Education Boards. A Handbook on School Safety was developed by the Ministry \nof Home Affairs in 2004.\nThe GoI- UNDP Disaster Risk Management Programme (DRM) launched in 2002 was one of the \nlargest community-based disaster risk management programmes in Asia. In order to generate \nawareness among students and teachers on how to respond to disasters, a component on School \nSafety was developed under the DRM Programme. The prime objective of this initiative was “school \nsafety through education and building safer schools”. It brought together children, teachers and \nschool managers through participatory activities that concern children’s safety during disasters. \nUnder this component, School level disaster management plans were developed and capacity \nenhancement programmes including mock-drills were conducted for School Community. Extensive \ndisaster management trainings were conducted for teachers, school managers and education \ndepartment officials from Central and State Boards of Secondary Education. In total, 125,817 \nteachers were trained on Disaster Management at the district level. The Programme reached out \nto 4105 schools with 130,000 enrolled children. (Source: UNDP, 2007).\nIn parallel, the work of the UN bodies, several NGOs and INGOs have provided many useful \nlessons in developing the substantive aspects of the agenda.\nThe school safety agenda has thus evolved over the years. What initially was seen as a simple \nprovision of (child friendly) classrooms to protect children from the elements so that their education \nprogresses uninterrupted, expanded to look at structural safety, non-structural mitigation as well \nas capacity building of the larger school community for promoting safety.\nExtracts from a communication from Ministry of Finance regarding Revision of EFC \nFormat to address disaster management concerns in all the programmes and schemes \nof the government.\nAs per a communication from Ministry of Finance to all Ministries and Departments (ref no. 37(4) \n/ PFII/ 2003) of 19th June 2009, the Expenditure and Finance Committee (EFC) Note for approval \nof all ongoing and new programmes and schemes need to answer the following questions:\n“ 3F) Does the project involve any creation/modification of structural/ engineering assets including \nland reclamation or changes to existing land use plans? If yes, then the costs involved in prevention \nand mitigation of disaster(s) (natural and man-made) would need to be included fully in the \nproject cost.\nAnnexure\n\n37\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nb) \nIdentify the possible risks and analyze the likelihood and impact from earthquakes, floods, \ncyclones and landslides due to the location of the project sites as well as through secondary \nevidence.\nc) \nWhat are the land-use directives, regulations applicable?

Confirmation that the implementation of the selected mitigation \nmeasures will not create new risks.\ne) \nConfirmation that the design and engineering of the structure has taken into consideration \nthe National Building Code 2005, the appropriate BIS Codes and the NDMA guidelines. Other \nsources such as Indian Road Congress Manual, Ministry of Road Transport, Highways and \nShipping manual, Railway Board manual, Central Public Health Engineering Organisation \n(Min. of Urban Development) manual, Central Electricity Authority manual and Central \nWater Commission manual etc. may also be consulted where applicable.\nf) \nHas the cost of disaster treatment/mitigation measures been included in the \noverall project cost?\ng) \nAlso indicate that the whole process of risk assessment has been done based on available \ninformation and secondary evidence and the mitigation measure(s) are in conformity with \nthe statutory and other regulatory requirements and are the most viable ones in the present \ncircumstances.”\nThere has been a major revision in the requirements of the Expenditure and Finance \nCommittee (EFC) of Ministry of Finance, Government of India for approval of ongoing and new \nprogrammes and schemes of all the Ministries. Since 2009, the EFC note to be submitted by all \nministries includes a well defined set of questions with regard to disaster management. \nThe SSA Framework for Implementation has been revised in light of the RTE Act and a \ndedicated chapter on School Infrastructure has been provided. The chapter clearly brings out \nthe need and importance of Disaster Resistance in Schools and also gives norms and codes to be \nreferred.\nFurther, Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan Institutions have specified the space norms and appropriate \nsizes for school classrooms etc. in Kendriya Vidyalaya schools that are administered by the \nSangathan. \nRashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) guides the expansion strategy for Secondary \nSchools & Higher Secondary Schools. To provide access to secondary school for students, RMSA \nproposes up-gradation of upper primary schools through construction of classrooms laboratories, \ncomputer rooms, headmaster room, library rooms, separate toilets for girls and boys, appointment \nof additional teachers and strengthening of existing secondary schools. This scheme identifies \nEnvironment Management as an important aspect for improving quality and improving access \nof secondary education. It makes a reference to location/site selection related issues, and \nissues related to design pertaining to the difficult sites. RMSA also makes a reference to special \npurpose designs, construction related impacts, and issues related to provision and maintenance \nof facilities.\nKasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas (KGBV) scheme was launched by the Government of \nIndia in August, 2004 for setting up residential schools at upper primary level for girls belonging \npredominantly to the SC, ST, OBC and minorities in difficult areas. Initially it ran as a separate \nscheme, but was merged with the SSA with effect from 1st April, 2007. With the RTE Act, 2009 \ncoming into force with effect from 1st April 2010, and the SSA Framework of Implementation \nbeing revised to correspond to the RTE Act, the KGBV component of SSA is being implemented \nAnnexure\n\n38\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nin the overall context of child rights and child entitlements and in harmony with the spirit and \nstipulations of the Act. \nNational Building Code of India (NBC), published by Bureau of Indian Standards in 2005 serves \nas a Model Code for adoption by all agencies involved in school construction works. The Code \nattributes an ‘importance factor’ to ascertain the structural design of different types of building, \ndepending on the functional use of the structure, characterised by hazardous consequences of its \nfailure, its post-earthquake functional need, historic value, or economic importance. In section \n5.3.4, the Code attributes Importance Factor of 1.5 to Schools, higher than all other buildings \nindicating the importance of schools. \nHon’ble Supreme Court of India has also come out with its judgment in support of school safety, \nand insisted on adherence to NBC standards in school building specifications and construction. \nIn its judgment of April13, 2009 on Writ Petition (Civil)no. 483 of 2004, the court has recognized \nthat “Right to education incorporates the provision of safer schools” and given direction on several \naspects of school safety including : \na) \nFire Safety Measures in Schools (Point 3.1 page 23)\nb) \nTraining of School Teachers and other Staff (Point 3.2 page 25)\nc) \nSchool Building Specifications (Point 3.3 page 27)\nd) \nClearances & Certificates (Point 3.4 page 29)\nIn response to Writ Petition (Civil) no.483 of 20044 , the court held that “Evaluation of structural \naspect of the school may be carried out periodically…the concerned engineers and officials must \nstrictly follow the National Building Code. The safety certificate be issued only after proper \ninspection. Dereliction in duty must attract immediate disciplinary action against the concerned \nofficials.”\nIn addition to policy interest in addressing structural aspects of safety, there have been changes \nin the school curriculum as well. The SSA, Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and state \nboards have introduced disaster education in curriculum for school education. \nThe most recent initiative by the government was the National School Safety Project \nimplemented by NDMA in 43 districts of 22 states of the country. The Programme, essentially pilot \nin nature, had the following components:\ni. \nFormulation of National School Safety Policy.\nii. \nCapacity building (Development of model school DM plan, including format for Mock drill; \nReview and approval of School DM Plans in selected schools; development of training \nmodules for training of state level master trainers, training of teachers and students)\niii. \nInformation, Education and Communication (Development of model templates for IEC material \nas well as Translation and printing of IEC material in local language and dissemination of IEC \nmaterial in all the schools)\niv. \nNon- Structural Mitigation Measures (Development of non-structural mitigation guidelines / \nchecklist for Rapid Visual Survey and implementation of such measures in project schools)\nv. \nDemonstrative Retrofitting\nState Government Initiatives \nGovernment of Assam has made it compulsory for all schools to have a Disaster Management \nPlan on the lines of a Model Disaster Management Plan uploaded on the official website of \nthe Secondary Education Department. Amendments are also being made in the Assam Non-\nGovernment Educational Institutions (Management & Control) Act, 2006 to make it compulsory \nfor all Non-Government Educational Institutions to adopt construction approved by GMC/GMDA \nAnnexure\n\n39\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nwith appropriate design. There is also an amendment to make it compulsory to hold mock drills at \nregular intervals. Fire extinguishers are also being provided to every school in the state.\nGovernment of Gujarat, initiated two programs namely Gujarat School Safety Initiative– I & II, \nfor promoting a culture of disaster safety in schools and reduce risk through structural and non-\nstructural measures in the schools. The programme focused on 152 schools in Phase I covering \n1,00,000 students (primary and secondary standards) and 1,500 teachers on the basics of disaster \nmanagement. As part of the long-term sustainability of the program, an assessment of non-\nstructural mitigation measures was completed and school safety clubs have been opened in all \nthe project schools. In Phase II, Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority is working towards \ncreation of cadre of master trainers and a pool of trained teachers at district level in disaster risk \nreduction across all the 25 districts of the State.\nGovernment of Himachal Pradesh, as part of the State Education Code 2013, has issued \ninstructions to all schools in the state for preparation of their own disaster management plan, \nwhich captures school specific hazards, vulnerabilities, resources and plan for mitigation. Detailed \nguidelines have also been issued for conducting mock drills, development of School Safety Plans \nand School Fire Safety DM Plan. The state has also developed a range of audio-visual materials for \nraising awareness on safety issues among children. All of these activities have been carried out as \npart of the GoI – UNDP DRR programme 2009 - 2012. As part of another initiative retrofitting of \nfew schools has also been carried out in the state. \nGovernment of NCT of Delhi, in its circular No. F.16/Estate/CC/Fire Safety/2011/3298 to \n3398 passed on 01/03/2011, issued directions to schools specifically with regard to fire safety. \nThese include detailed directions for different types of buildings for access, number of doors in \na class room, staircases, fire extinguishers, use of basement and captive water storage for Fire \nFighting and pumping arrangements. In the General measures, directive is laid out on the use of \nnon-combustible material for construction of the school building, maintenance of escape routes, \nstorage of LPG cylinders in the laboratories and electrical circuits.\nGovernment of Tamil Nadu, has issued G.O. Ms.No.131, Department of School Education, in \ncontinuance to G.O.Ms.No.1179, Public (law and orders) Department dated 20.7.2004. The order \nfollows from the Commission of enquiry for the incident of death due to fire accident at Sri Krishna \nAided Primary School at Kumbakonam, Thanjavur District on 16-07-2004. With regard to school \nsafety, the Commission made specific recommendations. A thorough review of the recognition / \napproval granted to the existing schools has to be undertaken. With reference to those schools \nwho have not obtained permission / approval / recognition, strict compliance with the micro level \nfulfillment of norms should be ensured by the Inspecting Officer concerned, through physical \nverification before recommending for permission / approval / recognition. \nPeriodical monitoring through spot inspection towards upkeep of the infrastructure has to be \nensured. Crash Training course for the teacher on crisis management and first aid is recommended. \nThe state has issued additional orders in 2012 suggesting measures to be followed for the safety \nof children studying in schools in all government / government aided and private schools in Tamil \nNadu. These include structural safety measures, safety precautions with regard to open wells, \nwater tanks, septic tanks and staircases etc. The order also talks of safe drinking water provision \nas well as safe sanitation facilities. In addition, safe electrical connections, seating arrangements, \nassembly class room environment and infrastructure, school vehicles and first aid have been \ncovered. \nGovt. of Haryana: State Policy on Safety Measures in Schools: The state has come out with \na specific policy concerning safety measures in schools. Broadly the document very appropriately \nthrows light on the various elements pertaining to school safety including constitution of respective \ncommittees, modes operandi for fund allocation, broad areas for education and training and \nimplications of non-compliance.\nAnnexure\n\n40\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nAnnexure – 3 : Trainings\nA broad list of trainings required for promotion of

Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nAnnexure – 7\nProcess of Safety Needs Assessment through Hazard Hunt Exercise: Experience from Bihar\nIn collaboration with Government of Bihar, UNICEF and its partners NGOs have implemented a School \nsafety initiative in eight districts of the state. Their experience has highlighted the potential of Hazard \nhunt as a tool for identifying safety needs of the school though a participatory methodology involving \nstudents, teachers, and  SMC members. The exercise culminates with the articulation of a well-defined \nmicro-plan that is then pursued with the PRIs for leveraging resources from various schemes besides \nSSA. The process followed for Hazard Hunt is given below:\ni. \nOrientation of School Disaster Management Committee members and Focal Point Teacher on \ndefinition of risk and vulnerabilities;\nii. \nDiscussion on the nature of risks that affect the physical wellbeing of  children,  and of the school \ncommunity;\niii. \nDiscussion on the nature of risks that affect access to education by children; \niv. \nOrganization of the group into smaller groups for Hazard Hunt. \nv. \nIdentification of risks and vulnerabilities inside and outside the school by separate groups;\nvi. \nDocumentation of risks identified by smaller groups and presentation to the larger group including \nFocal point teacher;\nvii. \nSuggested format for documentation of Hazard Hunt exercise  :\nS. \nNo.\nList of Vulnerabilities \nthat exist inside and \noutside  the school\nRisks \ninvolved\nProbable \nExtent of \nSeverity \nAny past incident(s) relating to \nthis risk, vulnerability\nvii. \nPrioritization of risks for action in the short and long term;\nix. \nDevelopment of Micro-plan to enlist solutions, sources of funding, responsiblities and timeline.\nAnnexure\n\n45\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nAnnexure – 8\nSchool DM Plan Model Template-National School Safety Programme (NSSP)\nSection 1 : Introduction:\na. \nSchool profile (attached format in Annexure 8 (i)\nb. \nAim and Objective of the plan\nc. \nGeographical location of the school.\nGuidance Note:\n● \nThis section of the plan will provide information relating to the school as per details given in \nAnnexure-I It should also mention the objective of the plan, the stakeholders who will be using \nthe plan and members who would be responsible for implementing, reviewing and updating the \nplan.\n● \nThis section can also include a map of the school.\nSection 2 : Hazard Risk and Vulnerability Assessment\na. \nNon-structural assessment (can be done practically by all teachers and select students in a \ngroup exercise)\nb. \nStructural assessment (to be done by a Civil Engineer, Licensed Building Surveyor)\nc. \nIdentification of hazards outside the school campus (Road Safety, Industrial Hazard, Chemical \nhazard, open drain flooding etc.)\nd. \nDatabase of past disasters/accidents which have affected the schools.\ne. \nIdentification of vulnerable locations within the school campus\nf. \nSummary of the key findings and identifications of action for mitigation.\nGuidance Note:\nThis section of the plan will focus on identifying the various vulnerable areas within the school building \nas well as the probable risks arising out of structural and non structural elements.\nFor identifying non-structural and structural weakness in the school building a committee may be \nconstituted comprising members of School Administration (Including Physical Education Teacher), \nofficer from nearest fire station/Civil defence post warden, Health Service Provider (doctor/nurse/\nhealth worker) from nearest health centre/hospital/nursing home, officer from the nearest police \nstation, engineers from PWD, SSA, Municipal Corporation. Zilla Parishad who may help in identifying \nthe structural and non-structural weaknesses in the building. Likewise this committee can also identify \nhazard outside the school campus particularly the hazard related to road/traffic outside the school \nbuilding, industrial (Chemical Hazard) which may be due to location of such an industry in vicinity of \nthe school.\nThis Hazard hunt activity will help in identifying some of the obvious risks like improper location of \nelectricity panel in the school, open electricity panels, live wire if any, improper placing of cupboards \nand furniture, obstruction in the escape route or object that can fall during the Earthquake such as \nglass panel, flowerpot etc.\nThis section of the plan can also document or provide details of any past disaster that had affected the \nschool or in the vicinity of the school.\nAnnexure\n\n46\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nSection 3 : Preparedness\nThis section of the plan should include the following:\na. \nConstitution of school DM Committee Composition of the Core Team and its roles and \nresponsibilities during different phases.\nb. \nConstitution of sub team and identification of roles and responsibilities of each of the sub \nteams/task force, before, during and after disaster. The school may comprise of the following \nteams/task forces.\ni. \nAwareness Generation, Warning and information dissemination team.\nii. \nEvacuation team.\niii. \nSearch and rescue team (only teachers to be member of this team)\niv. \nFire safety team\nv. \nFirst aid team.\nvi. \nBus safety team (for each bus) - wherever applicable.\nvii. \nSite security team.\nGuidance Note:\nThis section of the plan will focus on Preparedness. Higher Level of preparedness for disaster helps to \nminimise the loss of life and prevention of injures caused particularly during earthquakes for which \nthere is no warning. However certain other hazards like flood, cyclone etc. do have early warning \nsystem thereby giving some time for taking response. Children being the future of tomorrow should be \nensured a safe learning environment and prepared well to respond effectively during disasters. To put \nthis into practice it is recommended that every school constitutes a School Level Disaster Management \nCommittee along with sub committees to ensure better preparedness and response in disasters. The \nvarious committees constituted in a school will comprise of members from among teachers, non \nteaching staff as well students. However for certain committee like search and rescue students are not \nrecommended. The recommended structure for a School Disaster Management Committee is as follows:\n1. \nChairperson: Principal\n2. \nVice Principal, Heads of primary and middle sections\n3. \nEducation Officer/Deputy Education Officer for the zone\n4. \nParent Teacher Association President\n5. \n4 Students (NCC, NSS, Scouts and Guides, Head Boy and Head Girl)\n6. \nRepresentative \nof \nRelief/ \nRevenue/ \nDisaster \nManagement \nDepartment/ \nDistrict \nAdministration/ Municipal Corporation\n7. \nRepresentative of the Fire Services (from Closest Fire Station) or Civil defence personnel.\n8. \nRepresentative of Police (from Closest Police Station)\n9. \nRepresentative of Health Department (Local Doctor)\n10. \nA Warden from Civil Defence\nThe sub committees mentioned below will work under overall supervision of school DM Committee \n(SDMC).

This will include the list of various awareness generation programmes to be \nconducted by the school annually.\ng. \nAction plan for conducting Mock drills and development of a checklist to identify the gaps\nh. \nSteps for Updation of DM plan - indicating the time line and the process of doing it along with \nthe roles of teachers and other non teaching staff.\nGuiding notes for Resource inventory:\nAs part of preparedness exercise, each school must develop a School DM kit. It is suggested that a \nnetwork is established by the school management with the nearest hospital/ health centre/ health \nworker for help in case of emergency. The suggestive list of items which could be procured for school \nDM kit have been listed below. However, it is suggested that each school must have provision for other \nexternal resources (grants given by the State Government like MPLADs/ MLALADs etc.) to strengthen \nthis resource list further.\ni. Stretcher\n}\nProvision of School DM kit.\nii. Ladders\niii. Thick rope\niv. Torch\nv. First-aid box\nvi. Temporary shelter (tents and tarpaulins)\nvii. Sand buckets\nviii. Fire Extinguishers\nSchool map with evacuation plan:\nIt is recommended to prepare a floor wise evacuation plan and display it prominently at the notice \nboard on each of the floors. The evacuation plan may be discussed by the evacuation team with the \nteachers and students to generate awareness to help conduct mock drill. (A sample Evacuation Map is \nattached for reference as Annexure 8 (iii)\nGuiding note for Mock drill\nMock drills are the ways of rehearsing the preparedness plan. It is one of the last steps in preparedness. \nThe mock drill on earthquake, fire etc. may conducted at periodic interval preferably once in every \nAnnexure\n\n48\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nsix months and the deficiencies may be assessed for updation of the plan. This section of the plan \nshould clearly indicate the steps to be followed to conduct the mockdrills and the responsibilities of \nthe teachers, non teaching staff and students. If required school should invite the Fire Service Officers \nand trained Civil Defence volunteers for support. The steps to be followed for earthquake drill are \nmentioned below.\nEarthquake drill:\ni. \nPractice drop, cover and hold.\nii. \nEvacuate classroom in less than 1 minute without pushing and falling.\niii. \nEvacuate school in less than 4 minutes.\niv. \nLookout for friends.\nv. \nStay away from weak areas/ structures.\nvi. \nHelp those who need assistance (identification of task force in advance for rescue of special \nchildren).\nFire/ Chemical Accident/ Drill:\ni. \nEvacuation from classroom\nii. \nEnsure safe storage of inflammable liquids/ chemicals\niii. \nPut off electricity and remove or close down gas connections.\ni. \nCapacity building and training:\n \nCapacity Building and training of students and teachers is an important step to ensure safety of \nschool going community in a disaster situation. Every year appropriate number of teachers and \nstudents may be trained in various skills of disaster management.\n \nAction plan for training of teachers, non teaching staff and students on DM including all the task \nforces constituted and also organising refresher courses. This can also include documentation of \ndetails of trained teachers and students.\nj. \nAwareness generation and sensitization:\n \nAwareness generation/ sensitization is a part of preparedness measures aiming at sensitising \nand educating all the stakeholders including students, teachers and officials/ parents on issues \nrelating to school safety. It is suggested that an annual calendar of events may be prepared \nincluding various activities involving students/ teachers, etc. where experts from outside may \nalso be invited for giving their opinion on school safety issues.\n \nSome of the measures which could be undertaken by the school management for creating \nawareness are as follows:\na. \nThrough poster, audio-visual clips, organizing debate, quiz, sports activities, drawing \ncompetition, rally in schools.\nb. \nDisplay of important information on school notice board including school evacuation plan \nand weather news information.\nc. \nConducting seminars and lectures on making the learning environment safer and \ninvolvement of Parents in such seminars.\nd. \nObserving a month of safety in the year calendar of school as Preparedness month.\nSection 4 : Response:\na. \nHazards specific response plan including Crowd Management to avoid stampede on special days \nlike annual functions, sports day etc.\nAnnexure\n\n49\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nb. \nAlternate arrangement for continuation of school education. (Delivery of education during and \npost disaster situation particularly in cases where the school will be used as relief shelters).\nc. \nReporting of Emergencies/ Disasters to the Government\nd. \nSpecial provision for specially abled children.\nGuidance Note:\nThis section of the plan should be very precise, crisp indicating the various roles and responsibilities \nof teachers, non teaching staff and students during disaster situation. The plan should clearly mention \nthe steps to be followed in case of an earthquake, fire, flooding, cyclone or such emergent situation like \nstampede or health problems faced by any student. The plan should include all the steps to be taken \nup by the school management to ensure safety of the child including their safe evacuation from the \naffected site till the child is handed over to the parents. It will also include all other steps to be taken \nup by the management to ensure supply of essential services in the school like power, water and food \nand basic first aid during a disaster and immediately after it.\nSection 5 : Mitigation measures\na. \nListing of various Non-structural measures to be undertaken in the school along with \ntimeline.\ni. \nEnsuring clear passages, stairways which are to be used as evacuation routes.\nii. \nChemistry labs-the bottles used for storing the chemicals are secured and protected against \nshattering.\niii. \nFixating of Almirahs to the walls of staff rooms.\niv. \nSecuring fans and light from ceiling.\nv. \nFire safety measures\nb. \nSafety audit\ni. \nElectric safety audit-checking of the electrical system by an electrician.\nii. \nFire safety audit-checking for possible sources of fire and identifying inflammable items \nwithin the school\niii. \nInspection of quality of food getting served during mid-day meal.\niv. \nAudit of purity of water supply in school.\nv. \nInspection of the hygienic conditions in kitchen and washrooms.\nGuidance Note:\nThis section of the plan will focus on various mitigation measures to be undertaken by the school. \nMitigation Planning is a long term exercise and hence it is essential to divide the strategy prioritizing \nthe actions along with definite timeline. It is also necessary to prioritise the actions based on the \nnature of the threat and its potential to cause injuries and loss of life. Some of the non structural \nmitigation measure like anchorage of almirahs, clearance of the exit routes, relocation of the storage \nof laboratory items, installation of warning alarms could be done immediately by incurring minimal \ncosts, some other mitigation measures like major structural repair work will require more time and \nfund commitments.\nAs a part of mitigation action, school should also undertake periodic fire and electrical safety checks \nby involving officials from Electricity Department/ board, Fire Services, PWD etc. Other measures like \ntesting of purity of drinking water and hygienic conditions in the school should also be undertaken.\nAnnexure\n\n50\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\n(Annexure – 8 i)\nDetails of School Profile\n1. \nName of School and code number provided by Department of Education :\n2. \nPostal address with pin code :\n3. \nContact number :\n4. \nNumber of teachers : Male __________   Female __________\n5. \nNumber of Students : Male __________   Female __________\n6. \nNumber of differently-abled students : Male __________   Female __________\n7. \nSpecify the type of disability :\n8. \nDate of Construction of School building :\n9. \nNumber of Buildings in the school compound :\n10. \nNumber of classrooms :\n● \nNumber of Chemistry laboratories\n● \nNumber of Physics laboratories\n● \nNumber of Biology laboratories\n11. \nNumber of floors :\n12. \nNumber of staircases :\n13. \nDo you have a kitchen ?

      "17\nSCHOOL Safety\nPOLICY Guidelines\nCapacity building for school safety covers a range \nof actions spanning from awareness generation \nand sensitization to training on direct actions \nrequired by different stakeholders. Additionally, \ncapacity building is not a one-time activity; it \nrequires follow up of knowledge and skills imparted \nand regular value additions in the day to day \nworking of teachers, students and school staff. \nCapacity building actions for safe schools fall \nbroadly in two categories:\n3.4.1 \nGeneral training for students and \nschool staff:\nDelineating their expected roles, procedures and \nresponsibilities in relation to any emergency, \nthis \ntraining \nwould \ninclude \nstrengthening \nunderstanding of:\na. \nPotential disasters that may affect the \nschool community;\nb. \nWarning signals, emergency and crisis \ninstructions and mitigation actions for \ndifferent levels of response.\nc. \nEvacuation routes, and knowledge of safe \nspaces and shelter locations;\nd. \nFirst-aid and basic life support\ne. \nAvailability of personal and group counseling \nand support following a disaster; and \nf. \nUpdates in the disaster management plan \nthat affect the total population of the \nschool.\nThese trainings are necessary for preparation \nand regular up-dation of school level disaster \nmanagement plans as well as for effective \nexecution in case the need arises. Therefore \nregular practice through mock-drill exercises \ninvolving teachers together with children is critical \nfor sustaining the impact of safety initiatives. \nAwareness programmes for children on local \nhazards and risk reduction with relevant \nknowledge and life skills through discussions, \nstreet \nplays, \ndrawing \ncompetitions, \nquiz \ncompetitions, \nessay/ \nslogan \nwriting \nand \ndemonstration are proven ways of involving \nchildren in a meaningful manner. In addition, \nrallies, games/matches and other community \nlevel activities may be organised with inputs \nfrom DDMA/SDMA to make children as well as \nthe larger community aware.\n3.4.2 \nSpecialized \ntraining \nand \nskill \nbuilding:\nTraining would be imparted for performing \nspecialized roles as part of the School Disaster \nManagement Plan, for instance: \na. \nSpecific duties and procedures assigned to \nstudents, faculty and staff as part of the \nSchool Disaster Management Plan e.g. first \naid training, search and rescue etc.\nb. \nCoordination of the school safety needs \nassessment and integration of these needs \nwith the School Development Plan by School \nSafety Focal Point Teacher and Principals.\nc. \nPsycho-social support for students who \ncan benefit from counseling, undertaking \nactivities on trauma management, through \nwriting or art projects as well as making \nappropriate changes in the curriculum, for \nhealing and learning coping skills.\nSuch specialized skills can best be imparted \nby specialized institutions. State Governments \nneed to establish a formal mechanism such as \na Joint Plan of Action with specialized agencies \nsuch as SDRF and the Red Cross. SDMA needs \nto involve SDRF in training of Education Officer, \nSMC, Focal Point Teachers and student peer \neducators on practical skills such as search \nand rescue, first aid, basic - life support etc. \nBesides the School Safety Focal Point Teachers, \nall other teachers should be sensitized through \nthe SDMA/DDMA .In addition, District Institutes \nof Education and Training(DIETs) should also \ninclude school safety as part of their pre-service \nand in-service training programmes.\nSchool Safety Focal point teachers need to be \nprovided training on school safety concept and \nvarious activities related to execution of their \nresponsibilities as the School Safety Focal point \nteachers. State Council for Education and Training \n(SCERT) should train Master Trainers from each \nDistrict Institute of Education and Training (DIET) \nand Master Trainers of each DIET should in turn \nimpart training to school level stakeholders.\nThe content for training on school safety at \nall levels should be generated by SCERT, in \nconsultation with SDMA/DDMA. In addition, \nSCERT needs to develop child friendly teaching \nmaterial for teachers and students to engage \nthem on school safety issues. \nSection 3",
